The storm continued on a northwesterly track up through Virginia where it was downgraded to a Tropical Storm, and by early Friday morning, September 19th, it was near Latrobe, PA and heading northwest at about 30 miles per hour. The storm exited Pennsylvania by early afternoon, the 19th, with improving conditions beginning state-wide.

Rain from the outer bands of Isabel reached southeastern areas of PA by about midday on Thursday, September 18th, and continued to spread northwestward across the remainder of the state throughout the day and evening hours. Heavy rain was falling in southern portions of the State College county warning area (CWA) by late afternoon. Gusty winds were also developing over these southern areas as well.

Rain and wind continued overnight, affecting most of State College's CWA into Friday morning. Rainfall amounts exceeded 3 inches in far southwestern areas, with much of the central CWA seeing in excess of 1 inch of rain. Far north and northeastern areas saw less than an inch on average.

Sustained winds of 30 mph on average accompanied Isabel as it tracked northward, but damaging gusts of between 50 and 60 mph occurred over a wide area. After a summer of above-normal rainfall, creating soft soils and with trees still in full bloom, the gusty winds resulted in hundreds of reports of trees or tree limbs being knocked down. These took down utility poles and power lines in many parts of the CWA, causing numerous power outages as well as property damage. Significant tree and power line damage was reported in 29 of State College's CWA counties, with the most significant damage over the lower Susquehanna region.

Rain moved into the region during the second half of the morning, fell heavy at times during the afternoon and early evening and ended by the late evening. Rain began during the second half of the morning of the 6th and fell at its heaviest during the afternoon and early evening. The rain ended by late that evening. Storm totals averaged from around 2 inches to around 4 inches. The lightest amounts were in the Poconos, the heaviest in the Philadelphia northwest suburbs. The strongest winds occurred during the afternoon and early evening. While peak wind gusts were only around 40 mph, the duration of the wind combining with the heavy rain caused weak trees and tree limbs to fall down in the southeastern part of the state. About 50,000 homes and businesses lost power. Most power was restored by the evening of the 7th. Minor tidal flooding occurred during the early evening high tide as a storm surge of around two feet moved up tidal sections of the Delaware River. Many scheduled sporting events and other outdoor activities were either cancelled or postponed. About 50 flights in and out of Philadelphia International Airport were cancelled.||Southeastern Pennsylvania took the brunt of the power outages as about 43,000 homes and businesses lost power in PECO Energy's service area in and around Philadelphia. In Bucks County, about 14,000 homes and businesses lost power with most outages reported in Yardley, Bensalem, Northampton, Doylestown, Middletown and Lower Makefield. In Chester County, about 5,700 homes and businesses lost power, most in heavily wooded areas. One westbound lane of U.S. Route 422 was closed in North Coventry Township because of a downed tree. In Berks County, two homes were damaged by fallen trees: one on Hampden Boulevard in Reading and the other when a 100 foot sumac tree fell on it on South Park Road in Wyomissing.

Moderate stream and river flooding occurred in the Poconos and Lehigh Valley and moderate to major river flooding occurred in southeast Pennsylvania. For many places in southeastern Pennsylvania, it was the worst creek and river flooding since Hurricane Floyd in 1999 or the remnants of Hurricane Jeanne in 2004. Flooding along non-tidal sections of the Delaware River was minor to moderate. There were two direct storm caused deaths: a wind related death in Monroe County and a drowning in Montgomery County.  About 500,000 PECO Energy and 420,000 Pennsylvania Power and Light customers lost power in Eastern Pennsylvania. For both utilities this ranked within the top five outages of all time.  Preliminary damage estimates were around six million dollars. In addition to property damage, the winds and rains badly damaged the corn crop in southeastern Pennsylvania. The Delaware Water Gap National Recreational Area was closed through Labor Day Weekend (September 5th). ||Tropical storm force wind gusts overspread Eastern Pennsylvania during the evening of the 27th and persisted into the afternoon of the 28th. Peak wind gusts averaged around 50 mph. The strongest winds associated with Irene occurred at two distinct times. The first surge occurred during bands of heavier rain during the evening of the 27th and early morning of the 28th. The second peak occurred during the afternoon of the 28th when skies were clearing and deeper mixing of the atmosphere brought stronger winds to the ground. Most of the peak wind gusts occurred at this time. The rain associated with Irene overspread Eastern Pennsylvania during the late morning on the 27th, fell at its heaviest from during the evening of the 27th into the early morning of the 28th and ended during the early afternoon on the 28th. Event precipitation totals averaged 3 to 7 inches and caused widespread flooding. Because the flash flooding and flooding blended into one, all flooding related stormdata county entries were combined into one under flood events. The storm surge of 3 to 5 feet caused moderate tidal flooding along tidal sections of the Delaware River overnight on the 27th. Minor tidal flooding occurred during the high tide cycles from the 29th through the 31st. | |In Stroudsburg (Monroe County), a 44-year-old man died when a tree fell on him in his backyard. He pushed his son to safety. Governor Tom Corbett declared a state of emergency for the city of Philadelphia and the surrounding suburbs. The Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority halted all commuter rail service during the evening of the 27th as multiple tornado warnings were issued.  Three large shelters on the evening of August 27th in Philadelphia. The Philadelphia International Airport closed at 1030 p.m. EDT on the 27th and reopened on Monday the 29th. In Philadelphia, the storm left thousands without power. More than 500 trees fell in the city, seven buildings collapsed and twenty roads were closed. PECO Energy restored power by August 31st.||The highest wind gusts recorded during Irene were 57 mph in Mount Pocono (Monroe County), 53 mph in Allentown (Lehigh County), 52 mph at the Philadelphia International Airport (Philadelphia County), 48 mph in Reading (Berks County), 46 mph in Coatesville (Chester County), 45 mph in Northeast Philadelphia (Philadelphia County), 44 mph in Pottstown (Montgomery County), 44 mph in Newbold (Bucks County) and 40 mph in Quakertown (Bucks County). The high tide in Philadelphia reached 9.89 feet above mean lower low water during the early morning of the 28th. Moderate tidal flooding begins at 9.20 feet above mean lower low water. ||Hurricane Irene formed east of the Leeward Islands on Saturday the 20th. It moved northeast and passed over Puerto Rico overnight on the 21st. As Irene moved off the island, it intensified into a hurricane. Irene just bypassed the island of Hispaniola to its north and then passed over the Eastern Bahamas on the 25th as it reached category three hurricane strength. From the Bahamas, Irene moved nearly due north and slowly weakened to a category two hurricane on the 26th and a category one hurricane on the 27th. Irene made her initial landfall near Cape Lookout, North Carolina at 8 a.m. EDT on the 27th and then proceeded to the northnortheast and went back over the Atlantic Ocean near the Virginia and North Carolina border at 7 p.m. EDT on the 27th. From there Irene paralleled the Delmarva Peninsula and the center passed about 15 miles east of Delaware between 3 a.m. and 4 a.m. EDT on the 28th. Irene made her second landfall as a tropical storm on Brigantine Island, just north of Atlantic City, New Jersey at 535 a.m. EDT on the 28th.
