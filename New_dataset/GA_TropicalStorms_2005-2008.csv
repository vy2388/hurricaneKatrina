The remains of Cindy then moved northeast across southern Mississippi and central Alabama between Birmingham and Montgomery by 8 pm EDT on the 6th, then moved into north Georgia near Cedartown shortly after midnight then across north Georgia during the morning hours on July 7th.  Areas north of Cedartown, to Atlanta, to Gainesville experienced many hours of light to moderate rain with average rainfall amounts from 3 pm EDT on the 6th to 7 am EDT on the 7th of one to two inches.  However, the main problem with tropical storm Cindy was associated with spiral feeder bands that moved into west central Georgia shortly after 3 pm EDT July 6th and then tracked across west central, north central, and northeast Georgia during the evening hours.  The timing of the arrival of the spiral bands into the area combined with peak heating to produce several bands of strong thunderstorms with tornadoes, damaging winds, flash flooding, and even some hail.  The strongest thunderstorms, producing flash flooding and tornadoes, were confined to an area approximately 50 miles wide that extended from Franklin, to Peachtree City, to McDonough, to Monroe, to Danielsville.  Six tornadoes were confirmed during the evening hours including an F2 and two F1s in Henry county, and an F0 each in Meriwether, Coweta, and Fayette.  The F2 tornado in Henry county caused extensive damage to the Atlanta Motor Speedway and adjacent Tara Field Airport and then traveled into southeast Clayton county causing damage to 70 homes.  Numerous trees and power lines were down throughout many of the west central and Atlanta metropolitan counties, even where tornadoes did not occur.  Power outages were widespread and many residents of these areas were without power throughout the night.

Flash flooding was also a problem.  The thunderstorms associated with the spiral bands of Cindy dumped torrential rainfall across Heard, Carroll, Fayette, Clayton, Fulton, De Kalb, Spalding, Henry, Rockdale, Gwinnett, Newton, Walton, Morgan, Clarke, Barrow, and Madison counties.  Rainfall averaged three inches across most of these counties, with a band of rainfall in excess of five inches affecting northeast Coweta, northern Fayette, northern Clayton, southern Fulton, southern DeKalb, and much of Rockdale counties.  Rainfall at Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport was 5.14 inches, which set a daily record for the calendar day and also was the 6th largest one-day rainfall total ever recorded at that location.  Flash flooding was particularly severe in Peachtree City, where an 18-year old boy was swept to his death in a rain-swollen drainage ditch.  Flash flooding was also reported in Meriwether, Upson, Coweta, Fulton, De Kalb, and Morgan counties were several creeks and streams exceeded their banks and several roads were washed out.  A resident of Upson county was injured when he drove his truck into a rain-swollen stream that had washed out a road.

Estimated damages to North and Central Georgia in association with Tropical Storm Cindy were approximately $76,000,000.  The majority of this was the result of tornado damage, but over $500,000 was flash flood or flood related.

The remains of Cindy then moved northeast across southern Mississippi and central Alabama between Birmingham and Montgomery by 8 pm EDT on the 6th, then moved into north Georgia near Cedartown shortly after midnight then across north Georgia during the morning hours on July 7th.  Areas north of Cedartown, to Atlanta, to Gainesville experienced many hours of light to moderate rain with average rainfall amounts from 3 pm EDT on the 6th to 7 am EDT on the 7th of one to two inches.  However, the main problem with tropical storm Cindy was associated with spiral feeder bands that moved into west central Georgia shortly after 3 pm EDT July 6th and then tracked across west central, north central, and northeast Georgia during the evening hours.  The timing of the arrival of the spiral bands into the area combined with peak heating to produce several bands of strong thunderstorms with tornadoes, damaging winds, flash flooding, and even some hail.  The strongest thunderstorms, producing flash flooding and tornadoes, were confined to an area approximately 50 miles wide that extended from Franklin, to Peachtree City, to McDonough, to Monroe, to Danielsville.  Six tornadoes were confirmed during the evening hours including an F2 and two F1s in Henry county, and an F0 each in Meriwether, Coweta, and Fayette.  The F2 tornado in Henry county caused extensive damage to the Atlanta Motor Speedway and adjacent Tara Field Airport and then traveled into southeast Clayton county causing damage to 70 homes.  Numerous trees and power lines were down throughout many of the west central and Atlanta metropolitan counties, even where tornadoes did not occur.  Power outages were widespread and many residents of these areas were without power throughout the night.

Flash flooding was also a problem.  The thunderstorms associated with the spiral bands of Cindy dumped torrential rainfall across Heard, Carroll, Fayette, Clayton, Fulton, De Kalb, Spalding, Henry, Rockdale, Gwinnett, Newton, Walton, Morgan, Clarke, Barrow, and Madison counties.  Rainfall averaged three inches across most of these counties, with a band of rainfall in excess of five inches affecting northeast Coweta, northern Fayette, northern Clayton, southern Fulton, southern DeKalb, and much of Rockdale counties.  Rainfall at Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport was 5.14 inches, which set a daily record for the calendar day and also was the 6th largest one-day rainfall total ever recorded at that location.  Flash flooding was particularly severe in Peachtree City, where an 18-year old boy was swept to his death in a rain-swollen drainage ditch.  Flash flooding was also reported in Meriwether, Upson, Coweta, Fulton, De Kalb, and Morgan counties were several creeks and streams exceeded their banks and several roads were washed out.  A resident of Upson county was injured when he drove his truck into a rain-swollen stream that had washed out a road.

Estimated damages to North and Central Georgia in association with Tropical Storm Cindy were approximately $76,000,000.

The strongest thunderstorms, producing flash flooding and tornadoes, were confined to an area approximately 50 miles wide that extended from Franklin, to Peachtree City, to McDonough, to Monroe, to Danielsville.  Six tornadoes were confirmed during the evening hours including an F2 and two F1s in Henry county, and an F0 each in Meriwether, Coweta, and Fayette.  The F2 tornado in Henry county caused extensive damage to the Atlanta Motor Speedway and adjacent Tara Field Airport and then traveled into southeast Clayton county causing damage to 70 homes.  Numerous trees and power lines were down throughout many of the west central and Atlanta metropolitan counties, even where tornadoes did not occur.  Power outages were widespread and many residents of these areas were without power throughout the night.

Flash flooding was also a problem.  The thunderstorms associated with the spiral bands of Cindy dumped torrential rainfall across Heard, Carroll, Fayette, Clayton, Fulton, De Kalb, Spalding, Henry, Rockdale, Gwinnett, Newton, Walton, Morgan, Clarke, Barrow, and Madison counties.  Rainfall averaged three inches across most of these counties, with a band of rainfall in excess of five inches affecting northeast Coweta, northern Fayette, northern Clayton, southern Fulton, southern DeKalb, and much of Rockdale counties.  Rainfall at Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport was 5.14 inches, which set a daily record for the calendar day and also was the 6th largest one-day rainfall total ever recorded at that location.  Flash flooding was particularly severe in Peachtree City, where an 18-year old boy was swept to his death in a rain-swollen drainage ditch.  Flash flooding was also reported in Meriwether, Upson, Coweta, Fulton, De Kalb, and Morgan counties were several creeks and streams exceeded their banks and several roads were washed out.  A resident of Upson county was injured when he drove his truck into a rain-swollen stream that had washed out a road.

Estimated damages to North and Central Georgia in association with Tropical Storm Cindy were approximately $76,000,000.  The majority of this was the result of tornado damage, but over $500,000 was flash flood or flood related.  As noted above, there was also one flash flood-related death and one flash flood-related injury as a result of Tropical Storm Cindy.",123

Rainfall at Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport was 5.14 inches, which set a daily record for the calendar day and also was the 6th largest one-day rainfall total ever recorded at that location.

Flash flooding was also reported in Meriwether, Upson, Coweta, Fulton, De Kalb, and Morgan counties were several creeks and streams exceeded their banks and several roads were washed out.  A resident of Upson county was injured when he drove his truck into a rain-swollen stream that had washed out a road.

Estimated damages to North and Central Georgia in association with Tropical Storm Cindy were approximately $76,000,000.

The remains of Cindy then moved northeast across southern Mississippi and central Alabama between Birmingham and Montgomery by 8 pm EDT on the 6th, then moved into north Georgia near Cedartown shortly after midnight then across north Georgia during the morning hours on July 7th.  Areas north of Cedartown, to Atlanta, to Gainesville experienced many hours of light to moderate rain with average rainfall amounts from 3 pm EDT on the 6th to 7 am EDT on the 7th of one to two inches.  However, the main problem with tropical storm Cindy was associated with spiral feeder bands that moved into west central Georgia shortly after 3 pm EDT July 6th and then tracked across west central, north central, and northeast Georgia during the evening hours.  The timing of the arrival of the spiral bands into the area combined with peak heating to produce several bands of strong thunderstorms with tornadoes, damaging winds, flash flooding, and even some hail.  The strongest thunderstorms, producing flash flooding and tornadoes, were confined to an area approximately 50 miles wide that extended from Franklin, to Peachtree City, to McDonough, to Monroe, to Danielsville.  Six tornadoes were confirmed during the evening hours including an F2 and two F1s in Henry county, and an F0 each in Meriwether, Coweta, and Fayette.  The F2 tornado in Henry county caused extensive damage to the Atlanta Motor Speedway and adjacent Tara Field Airport and then traveled into southeast Clayton county causing damage to 70 homes.  Numerous trees and power lines were down throughout many of the west central and Atlanta metropolitan counties, even where tornadoes did not occur.  Power outages were widespread and many residents of these areas were without power throughout the night.

Flash flooding was also a problem.  The thunderstorms associated with the spiral bands of Cindy dumped torrential rainfall across Heard, Carroll, Fayette, Clayton, Fulton, De Kalb, Spalding, Henry, Rockdale, Gwinnett, Newton, Walton, Morgan, Clarke, Barrow, and Madison counties.  Rainfall averaged three inches across most of these counties, with a band of rainfall in excess of five inches affecting northeast Coweta, northern Fayette, northern Clayton, southern Fulton, southern DeKalb, and much of Rockdale counties.  Rainfall at Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport was 5.14 inches, which set a daily record for the calendar day and also was the 6th largest one-day rainfall total ever recorded at that location.  Flash flooding was particularly severe in Peachtree City, where an 18-year old boy was swept to his death in a rain-swollen drainage ditch.  Flash flooding was also reported in Meriwether, Upson, Coweta, Fulton, De Kalb, and Morgan counties were several creeks and streams exceeded their banks and several roads were washed out.  A resident of Upson county was injured when he drove his truck into a rain-swollen stream that had washed out a road.

Estimated damages to North and Central Georgia in association with Tropical Storm Cindy were approximately $76,000,000.

The strongest thunderstorms, producing flash flooding and tornadoes, were confined to an area approximately 50 miles wide that extended from Franklin, to Peachtree City, to McDonough, to Monroe, to Danielsville.  Six tornadoes were confirmed during the evening hours including an F2 and two F1s in Henry county, and an F0 each in Meriwether, Coweta, and Fayette.  The F2 tornado in Henry county caused extensive damage to the Atlanta Motor Speedway and adjacent Tara Field Airport and then traveled into southeast Clayton county causing damage to 70 homes.  Numerous trees and power lines were down throughout many of the west central and Atlanta metropolitan counties, even where tornadoes did not occur.  Power outages were widespread and many residents of these areas were without power throughout the night.

Flash flooding was also a problem.  The thunderstorms associated with the spiral bands of Cindy dumped torrential rainfall across Heard, Carroll, Fayette, Clayton, Fulton, De Kalb, Spalding, Henry, Rockdale, Gwinnett, Newton, Walton, Morgan, Clarke, Barrow, and Madison counties.  Rainfall averaged three inches across most of these counties, with a band of rainfall in excess of five inches affecting northeast Coweta, northern Fayette, northern Clayton, southern Fulton, southern DeKalb, and much of Rockdale counties.  Rainfall at Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport was 5.14 inches, which set a daily record for the calendar day and also was the 6th largest one-day rainfall total ever recorded at that location.  Flash flooding was particularly severe in Peachtree City, where an 18-year old boy was swept to his death in a rain-swollen drainage ditch.  Flash flooding was also reported in Meriwether, Upson, Coweta, Fulton, De Kalb, and Morgan counties were several creeks and streams exceeded their banks and several roads were washed out.  A resident of Upson county was injured when he drove his truck into a rain-swollen stream that had washed out a road.

Estimated damages to North and Central Georgia in association with Tropical Storm Cindy were approximately $76,000,000.  The majority of this was the result of tornado damage, but over $500,000 was flash flood or flood related.  As noted above, there was also one flash flood-related death and one flash flood-related injury as a result of Tropical Storm Cindy.",151

Rainfall at Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport was 5.14 inches, which set a daily record for the calendar day and also was the 6th largest one-day rainfall total ever recorded at that location.  Flash flooding was particularly severe in Peachtree City, where an 18-year old boy was swept to his death in a rain-swollen drainage ditch.  Flash flooding was also reported in Meriwether, Upson, Coweta, Fulton, De Kalb, and Morgan counties were several creeks and streams exceeded their banks and several roads were washed out.  A resident of Upson county was injured when he drove his truck into a rain-swollen stream that had washed out a road.

Estimated damages to North and Central Georgia in association with Tropical Storm Cindy were approximately $76,000,000.

The remains of Cindy then moved northeast across southern Mississippi and central Alabama between Birmingham and Montgomery by 8 pm EDT on the 6th, then moved into north Georgia near Cedartown shortly after midnight then across north Georgia during the morning hours on July 7th.  Areas north of Cedartown, to Atlanta, to Gainesville experienced many hours of light to moderate rain with average rainfall amounts from 3 pm EDT on the 6th to 7 am EDT on the 7th of one to two inches.  However, the main problem with tropical storm Cindy was associated with spiral feeder bands that moved into west central Georgia shortly after 3 pm EDT July 6th and then tracked across west central, north central, and northeast Georgia during the evening hours.  The timing of the arrival of the spiral bands into the area combined with peak heating to produce several bands of strong thunderstorms with tornadoes, damaging winds, flash flooding, and even some hail.  The strongest thunderstorms, producing flash flooding and tornadoes, were confined to an area approximately 50 miles wide that extended from Franklin, to Peachtree City, to McDonough, to Monroe, to Danielsville.  Six tornadoes were confirmed during the evening hours including an F2 and two F1s in Henry county, and an F0 each in Meriwether, Coweta, and Fayette.  The F2 tornado in Henry county caused extensive damage to the Atlanta Motor Speedway and adjacent Tara Field Airport and then traveled into southeast Clayton county causing damage to 70 homes.  Numerous trees and power lines were down throughout many of the west central and Atlanta metropolitan counties, even where tornadoes did not occur.  Power outages were widespread and many residents of these areas were without power throughout the night.

Flash flooding was also a problem.  The thunderstorms associated with the spiral bands of Cindy dumped torrential rainfall across Heard, Carroll, Fayette, Clayton, Fulton, De Kalb, Spalding, Henry, Rockdale, Gwinnett, Newton, Walton, Morgan, Clarke, Barrow, and Madison counties.  Rainfall averaged three inches across most of these counties, with a band of rainfall in excess of five inches affecting northeast Coweta, northern Fayette, northern Clayton, southern Fulton, southern DeKalb, and much of Rockdale counties.  Rainfall at Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport was 5.14 inches, which set a daily record for the calendar day and also was the 6th largest one-day rainfall total ever recorded at that location.  Flash flooding was particularly severe in Peachtree City, where an 18-year old boy was swept to his death in a rain-swollen drainage ditch.  Flash flooding was also reported in Meriwether, Upson, Coweta, Fulton, De Kalb, and Morgan counties were several creeks and streams exceeded their banks and several roads were washed out.  A resident of Upson county was injured when he drove his truck into a rain-swollen stream that had washed out a road.

Estimated damages to North and Central Georgia in association with Tropical Storm Cindy were approximately $76,000,000.

Tropical Storm Tammy developed off of Cape Canaveral Florida and moved north-northeast toward northeast Florida.  The strongest wind band and rains were located well north of the center and dropped a large amount of rainfall across southeast Georgia.  This rainfall combined with heavy rainfall and high tides over the previous days, due to strong northeast gradient flow, caused extensive flooding across the area.  Peak winds in coastal Georgia were 40 knots at McKinnon Airport (KSSI) on Saint Simons Island at 20:53 EDT and 38 knots at GlynnCo Airport (KBQK) at 21:00 EDT.  Storm Tides averaged 2 to 3.25 feet above astronomical tide levels during both low and high tide. This tended to block storm water runoff drainage in portions of southeast Georgia.

Rainfall totals for the 5th and 6th were...
McKinnon (KSSI): 10/5 4.68 inches & 10/6 0.63 inches
Brunswick COOP Site (BRUG1): 10/5 0.5 inches & 10/6 missing
Woodbine COOP Site (WBNG1): 10/5 4.52 inches & 10/6 1.56 inches
Nahunta COOP Site (NAHG1): 10/5 3.05 inches & 10/6 4.71 inches
A trained spotter on Saint Simons Island .66 miles north of McKinnon Airport (KSSI) reported 6.4 inches of rain on 10/5 and 0.74 on 10/6.  This spotter also recorded 13.06 inches of rain from 10/1 through 10/6 (in an 8 inch rain gage).  This is consistent with WSR 88D radar storm total estimates which indicate a 12 to 15 inch accumulation band from Kingsland/St. Marys, Ga north to near Darien, Ga. and extending inland 18 to 20 miles.  The spotter also reported tides close to those of Hurricane Frances and this is consistent with tide gage observations taken at Fernandina Beach, Florida (the Saint Simons Island tide gage was out of service during the event).  

Aerial and poor drainage flooding (mainly due to high tide levels) occurred on Green Swamp Rd, north of the railroad tracks; the Cypress Run subdivision; the College Park subdivision; the Magnolia Park subdivision; and the city of Brunswick from Wolfe Rd. east to Johnston St. and from K St. north to Q St. please refer to the flooding event on 10/7/05 for a total number of flooded structures.

Seas of 4 to 6 feet were reported at Saint Simons Island.

A brief tornado touched down near Spur 25 and Interstate 98 Wednesday evening and moved north-northeast toward New Hope Plantation. A hotel suffered roof damage and a mobile home on Gatch Ln. was also damaged. Trees and power lines were snapped along its path.","",273

Heavy rainfall occurred across the Suwannee River Valley. 

The lowest southeast Georgia mean sea level pressure was 1002.6 mb measured in Alma as the center moved very near the city during the early morning hours of June 14th around 00:53Z.  The lowest mean sea level readings across southeast Georgia ranged from 1002.6 mb in Alma to 1007.2 mb at St. Simons Island, Ga. 

Maximum sustained winds recorded were 38 knots/44 mph in Brunswick, Ga on June 13th around 23:22Z.  Stations generally reported sustained winds of 25-38 knots (29-44 mph).  Scattered trees and power lines were blown down across southeast Georgia. Most wind damage occurred during the afternoon and early evening of June 13th. 

Wave heights reached 6-9 ft across the coastal waters.  The maximum height observed was at the St. Augustine buoy 41012 on June 13th around 1920Z.  Storm tides at St. Simons Island ran 0.98 ft above normal astronomical tide predictions on June 13th around 12Z.
 
Rainfall totals across southeast Georgia ranged from 1 to 6 inches. The heaviest rainfall 5.48 inches was recorded in Echols County. Some minor temporary flooding of flood prone occurred, but the rainfall was beneficial to the area helping it recover from a minor drought period.  River flooding was not a concern.
