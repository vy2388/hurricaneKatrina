The NERRS site on Sapelo Island measured a peak wind gust of 60 mph during the event.","Irma first developed into a tropical storm on August 30th about 420 miles west of the Cabo Verde Islands, and within 24 hours strengthened into a hurricane.  Irma continued to intensify and became a major hurricane over the eastern Atlantic on September 1st.  After undergoing a brief period of weakening on September 2nd, Irma once again strengthened into a major hurricane on September 3rd and maintained major hurricane status through September 10th when it made landfall on the southwest Florida coast.  During this extended period as a major hurricane, Irma set numerous intensity records for a hurricane in the Atlantic basin.  Maximum sustained winds reached 185 mph, making Irma the strongest storm on record to exist in the Atlantic Ocean outside of the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico.  Also, Irma���s 185 mph maximum sustained winds are tied for the second strongest maximum winds all time in an Atlantic hurricane.  The minimum central pressure reached during Irma���s life cycle was 914 mb which is the lowest pressure on record by an Atlantic hurricane outside of the western Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico.  Furthermore, Irma maintained Category 5 status for 3 consecutive days which is the longest on record for an Atlantic hurricane.  Irma stayed on a general westward track through September 5th when it began a gradual turn to the west-northwest.  On this west-northwestward track, Irma eventually skirted along the north coast of Cuba on September 9th before turning northward toward Florida on September 10th.  Irma officially made landfall at Marco Island, FL at 3:35 pm September 10 as a Category 3 hurricane.  Following landfall, Irma tracked to the north-northwest and eventually the northwest as it progressed up the western side of the Florida peninsula.  Irma steadily weakened during this time and was downgraded to a tropical storm near the big bend of Florida at 8:00 am on September 11th.  Through the rest of September 11th, Irma tracked to the northwest into southern Georgia and widespread impacts occurred across the Southeast.||Despite the fact that the center of Irma tracked well to the west of the southeast Georgia and southeast South Carolina region, it still caused significant impacts due to heavy rainfall, strong winds, tornadoes, and storm surge.  Feeder bands around Irma continuously moved onshore on September 11th and produced very heavy rainfall rates with rainfall totals generally ranging from 3 to 9 inches.  The peak storm total rainfall of 9.07��� was recorded by a CoCoRaHS observer near Beaufort, SC.  Daily record rainfall totals for September 11th were recorded at all 3 climate sites in the area: 5.51��� at the Charleston International Airport (KCHS), 4.53��� at Downtown Charleston (KCXM), and 4.74��� at the Savannah-Hilton Head International Airport (KSAV).  This widespread heavy rain resulted in several reports of flash flooding with water entering homes and businesses.  Wind damage produced numerous power outages across the region with some damage to structures and numerous downed trees.  The strongest winds were confined to coastal locations, but frequent gusts into the 40-50 mph range occurred well inland.  The maximum sustained wind recorded was 59 mph by the Weatherflow site on the Folly Beach Pier (XFOL) and the maximum wind gust recorded was 76 mph by the Weatherflow site near Beaufort (XBUF).  One fatality and 1 injury occurred from trees falling on homes and across roadways in southeast South Carolina.  The entire southeast Georgia and southeast South Carolina coast was impacted by storm surge generally ranging from 3 to 6 feet.

Irma continued to intensify and became a major hurricane over the eastern Atlantic on September 1st.  After undergoing a brief period of weakening on September 2nd, Irma once again strengthened into a major hurricane on September 3rd and maintained major hurricane status through September 10th when it made landfall on the southwest Florida coast.  During this extended period as a major hurricane, Irma set numerous intensity records for a hurricane in the Atlantic basin.  Maximum sustained winds reached 185 mph, making Irma the strongest storm on record to exist in the Atlantic Ocean outside of the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico.  Also, Irma���s 185 mph maximum sustained winds are tied for the second strongest maximum winds all time in an Atlantic hurricane.  The minimum central pressure reached during Irma���s life cycle was 914 mb which is the lowest pressure on record by an Atlantic hurricane outside of the western Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico.

Wind damage produced numerous power outages across the region with some damage to structures and numerous downed trees.  The strongest winds were confined to coastal locations, but frequent gusts into the 40-50 mph range occurred well inland.  The maximum sustained wind recorded was 59 mph by the Weatherflow site on the Folly Beach Pier (XFOL) and the maximum wind gust recorded was 76 mph by the Weatherflow site near Beaufort (XBUF).

However, after approximately a week of slow development, the system moved into warm Gulf of Mexico waters and rapidly intensified into a major hurricane as it moved north towards the Florida Panhandle. After a 2-day long intensification period over the eastern Gulf, Michael made landfall as an unprecedented (for the region) high-end category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale in the Florida Panhandle with maximum sustained wind speed of 155 mph and a minimum pressure 919 mb. Based on wind, Michael is the fourth most powerful hurricane to hit the United States, behind the Labor Day Hurricane (1935), Hurricane Camille (1969) and Hurricane Andrew (1992), and the most powerful storm to impact the Florida Panhandle in recorded history.  Based on central pressure, Michael is the third most powerful hurricane to hit the United States, behind only the Labor Day Hurricane (1935) and Hurricane Camille (1969).  The storm caused catastrophic damage from wind and storm surge, particularly in the Panama City Beach to Mexico Beach to Cape San Blas areas. The widespread catastrophic damage spread well inland as Hurricane Michael remained at category 3 strength into southwest Georgia.||One of the hardest hit locations was from Mexico Beach to Indian Pass where 9 to 14 feet of peak storm surge inundation was observed. In addition, wave action caused even higher total water values and this resulted in waves destroying the second story of multiple buildings in Mexico Beach.||At St. Joseph Peninsula State Park on Cape San Blas, the storm surge cut through the peninsula, creating two inlets, resulting in portions of the park no longer being accessible by vehicle. These new inlets truly demonstrate the power of storm surge.||While preliminary peak storm surge inundation was slightly less east of Indian Pass, values were still life-threatening and caused significant damage. Along the coast, portions of U.S. 98 and Alligator Drive were washed out and had to be patched/repaved. In Carrabelle, water was high enough to enter a restaurant, resulting in damage to furniture. In addition, numerous homes along the coast were destroyed or damaged as water slammed against the structures.||In addition to the life-threatening storm surge, structural damage was extensive particularly across the Florida Panhandle. Preliminary data assessments indicate almost 50,000 structures were affected across the Florida Panhandle, western Big Bend, southwest Georgia and southeast Alabama. Of these, more than 3,000 structures were destroyed. Homes and businesses were not the only structures impacted. The Hurricane Michael Preliminary Virtual Assessment Team (P-VAT) report from the Structural Extreme Event Reconnaissance Network indicated that two hospitals in Bay County, Bay Medical Sacred Heart and Gulf Coast Regional Medical Center also sustained significant damage. One hospital had glass crack and cladding stripped off the building while the other hospital had issues with power and water. Tyndall Air Force Base (AFB), that experienced the eye of Hurricane Michael, experienced catastrophic damage with every building on base experiencing some roof damage. A nearby elementary school had a portion of its roof ripped off. During the height of the storm, before the transmission stopped, a sensor at Tyndall AFB measured a gust to 139 mph.||The wind damage was not confined to the coastline, but extended well inland. In Marianna, businesses lost their roofs and the exterior wall of some buildings collapsed as the roof was lost. In Donalsonville, GA, where a 115 mph gust was measured, roof damage was also observed and at least one silo was flipped over. Even in Albany, GA, signs were blown down and roofs were peeled off buildings.||In addition to extensive structural damage, hurricane force winds caused widespread power outages across a large portion of the tri-state region. Nearly 100% of customers across a large portion of the Florida Panhandle lost power, with some of these outages lasting weeks. These widespread power outages extended into southwest Georgia with 100% of customers losing power all the way up to Lee County, GA!||Property damage estimates were still being calculated at the time of this publication and will likely rise further from what is indicated here.  However, one estimate of insured losses from the state of Florida alone was as high as $4.2 billion.||The catastrophic winds also resulted in damage to the timber and agricultural communities across Florida and Georgia.

In addition to damage costs, replanting in the more severely damaged areas could be an addition $240 million. This damage also has impacts to the wildfire potential with additional forest fuels from downed trees. |According to Florida Commissioner of Agriculture Adam Putnam, the state suffered nearly $1.5 billion in agricultural damages due to Michael.

The estimated value of this land is $762,683,909. Catastrophic damage was mainly confined to Seminole, Decatur and Miller Counties with severe damage extending into Dougherty and Terrell Counties.  Additional crop damage occurred in Georgia to cotton, vegetables, pecans, poultry, peanuts, and timber.  According to Georgia Agriculture Commissioner Gary Black, estimated damages were as follows:  Cotton $300-$900 million, Vegetables $480 million, Pecans $560 million, Poultry $25 million, Peanuts $10-$20 million, and Timber $1 billion.||Inland flooding associated with Hurricane Michael across the tri-state region was limited as the hurricane quickly tracked across the area.

With these higher rainfall amounts isolated, only a few areas of inland flooding were observed. In Bay County, record flooding was observed on the Econfina Creek at State Road 20 with 26.17 feet (NAVD88). This resulted in the SR-20 bridge being overtopped.

However, after approximately a week of slow development, the system moved into warm Gulf of Mexico waters and rapidly intensified into a major hurricane as it moved north towards the Florida Panhandle. After a 2-day long intensification period over the eastern Gulf, Michael made landfall as an unprecedented (for the region) high-end category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale in the Florida Panhandle with maximum sustained wind speed of 155 mph and a minimum pressure 919 mb. Based on wind, Michael is the fourth most powerful hurricane to hit the United States, behind the Labor Day Hurricane (1935), Hurricane Camille (1969) and Hurricane Andrew (1992), and the most powerful storm to impact the Florida Panhandle in recorded history.

Of these, more than 3,000 structures were destroyed. Homes and businesses were not the only structures impacted. The Hurricane Michael Preliminary Virtual Assessment Team (P-VAT) report from the Structural Extreme Event Reconnaissance Network indicated that two hospitals in Bay County, Bay Medical Sacred Heart and Gulf Coast Regional Medical Center also sustained significant damage. One hospital had glass crack and cladding stripped off the building while the other hospital had issues with power and water. Tyndall Air Force Base (AFB), that experienced the eye of Hurricane Michael, experienced catastrophic damage with every building on base experiencing some roof damage. A nearby elementary school had a portion of its roof ripped off. During the height of the storm, before the transmission stopped, a sensor at Tyndall AFB measured a gust to 139 mph.||The wind damage was not confined to the coastline, but extended well inland. In Marianna, businesses lost their roofs and the exterior wall of some buildings collapsed as the roof was lost. In Donalsonville, GA, where a 115 mph gust was measured, roof damage was also observed and at least one silo was flipped over. Even in Albany, GA, signs were blown down and roofs were peeled off buildings.||In addition to extensive structural damage, hurricane force winds caused widespread power outages across a large portion of the tri-state region. Nearly 100% of customers across a large portion of the Florida Panhandle lost power, with some of these outages lasting weeks. These widespread power outages extended into southwest Georgia with 100% of customers losing power all the way up to Lee County, GA!||Property damage estimates were still being calculated at the time of this publication and will likely rise further from what is indicated here.  However, one estimate of insured losses from the state of Florida alone was as high as $4.2 billion.||The catastrophic winds also resulted in damage to the timber and agricultural communities across Florida and Georgia. According to the Florida Forest Service, in Florida, timber damage costs estimates were over $1.2 billion dollars with almost 3 million acres of forested land damaged. In addition to damage costs, replanting in the more severely damaged areas could be an addition $240 million. This damage also has impacts to the wildfire potential with additional forest fuels from downed trees. |According to Florida Commissioner of Agriculture Adam Putnam, the state suffered nearly $1.5 billion in agricultural damages due to Michael. The estimated damages were as follows: Forestry $1.3 billion, Cotton $49.9 million, Cattle $43.3 million, Peanuts $23 million, Nurseries and Floriculture $16.1 million, Poultry and Eggs $10 million, Vegetables $8.6 million, Other Field Crops $7.3 million, Dairy $6.4 million, Aquaculture $5 million, Fruit $4.4 million, Tree Nuts $4.1 million, and Apiary $2 million. ||In Georgia, 2,368,226 acres of forestland was impacted by Hurricane Michael. The estimated value of this land is $762,683,909. Catastrophic damage was mainly confined to Seminole, Decatur and Miller Counties with severe damage extending into Dougherty and Terrell Counties.  Additional crop damage occurred in Georgia to cotton, vegetables, pecans, poultry, peanuts, and timber.  According to Georgia Agriculture Commissioner Gary Black, estimated damages were as follows:  Cotton $300-$900 million, Vegetables $480 million, Pecans $560 million, Poultry $25 million, Peanuts $10-$20 million, and Timber $1 billion.||Inland flooding associated with Hurricane Michael across the tri-state region was limited as the hurricane quickly tracked across the area. A maximum rainfall total of 6.84 inches was observed near Crossroads, GA (Quitman County) with the second highest amount for the region recorded in Calhoun County, FL with 6.66 inches. With these higher rainfall amounts isolated, only a few areas of inland flooding were observed. In Bay County, record flooding was observed on the Econfina Creek at State Road 20 with 26.17 feet (NAVD88). This resulted in the SR-20 bridge being overtopped. In addition, in Calhoun County, FL, moderate flooding occurred on the Chipola River near Altha. A few homes were impacted downstream from the gauge and significant damage was sustained to the fish camps along the river.  There were no recorded tornadoes across the Florida Panhandle, Big Bend, southwest Georgia or southeast Alabama associated with Hurricane Michael.",152

Michael then continued to strengthen to a Category 1 hurricane while tracking north just off the western Cuba coast on October, 8th before gaining latitude and rapidly intensifying to a high-end Category 3 hurricane in the Gulf Of Mexico on October 9th. The major hurricane continued to track north, then north-northeast early on October 10th, strengthening to a high-end Category 4 hurricane with sustained winds of 155 mph and a minimum central pressure of 919 mb while making landfall near Mexico Beach, Florida at 2 PM EDT. Michael then weakened while moving inland, but maintained hurricane strength for approximately 10 hours while heading northeast over the Florida Peninsula and south central Georgia. Michael then maintained tropical storm strength October 11th, tracking northeast over central Georgia and the central Carolinas, before eventually shifting off the southern Virginia coast and transitioning into an extratropical cyclone over the Western Atlantic on October 12th. Minimum surface pressures of 999.3 mb at Savannah International Airport (KSAV), 1000.3 mb at Charleston International Airport (KCHS), 995.6 mb at Statesboro, GA (KTBR) and 994.2 mb at Allendale County Airport, SC were recorded as the center of Michael passed inland.   ||Across southeast Georgia and southeast South Carolina, the main impacts from Michael included wind damage in the form of isolated to scattered trees and power lines blown down, heavy rainfall and minor levels of storm surge. There were no reports of injuries or fatalities across the area.| |Storm total rainfall amounts generally ranged from 1.0 to 3.5 inches across the area. A peak storm total rainfall of 3.65 inches was recorded at Jamestown, SC while a peak storm total rainfall of 3.56 inches was recorded at Fort Stewart, GA. Heavy rains also led the Santee River at Jamestown, SC to reach minor flood stage on October 12th. ||Wind damage, mainly in the form of downed trees, produced numerous power outages and damage to a few homes as well as automobiles. On October 11th, a maximum sustained wind of 43 mph occurred at the Folly Beach Pier in South Carolina and at Tybee Island South in Georgia. A maximum sustained wind of 42 kt also occurred at Fort Sumter in the Charleston Harbor. A maximum wind gust of 57 mph occurred at Isle of Palms and the Folly Beach Pier in South Carolina and at Tybee Island South in Georgia. A maximum wind gust of 53 kt also occurred at the Capers Nearshore Buoy in nearshore waters. ||Storm Surge was minor along the beaches, but isolated damage was reported to a dock along the Charleston County coast. A peak surge of 2.29 ft occurred at the Fort Pulaski tide gauge at 154 AM October 11th while a peak surge of 2.07 ft occurred at the Charleston Harbor tide gauge at 212 AM October 11th.",153
