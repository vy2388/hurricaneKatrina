High tides of around 3.1 feet resulted in some beach erosion at Rutherford Beach and Constance Beach.  At Gulf Breeze Beach, at least two feet of sand was lost for a 500 yard wide stretch.  Sand dunes at Little Florida Beach and Long Beach were eroded slightly at the base of six to ten foot dunes.

Jetty Road in downtown Cameron had only minor flooding.  In Holly Beach, water rose to the second row of camps, but did not enter any of the buildings.  On Highway 82 between Holly Beach and Johnson Bayou, spray from seven foot seas caused minor flooding, but the highway was never closed.  Four jail inmates were able to clean debris within half a day using push brooms.  Five camps at Gulf Breeze Beach had water rise to the first floor, causing minor damage.  The access road to Martin Beach at Johnson Bayou was still flooded three days after the tides had decreased.

Wind gusts along the coast were between 30 and 40 knots at the height of the storm.  Between two and four inches of rain fell across Cameron Parish, but the Doppler radar indicated much more fell over the Gulf coastal waters.

No evacuations were ordered for Cameron Parish. No deaths or injuries were reported.",1

After a period of erratic movement, Frances settled on a northwest track that brought it ashore in the early morning hours of September 11th between Port Aransas and Port Oconner, Texas.  Due to the large pressure difference between Tropical Storm Frances and a high pressure system over the eastern United States, a prolonged period of strong east and southeast winds that occasionally reached tropical storm force affected coastal sections of southeast Louisiana.  Peak wind gusts of 60 mph at 1029 CST on the 10th and 55 mph at 1826 PM on the 10th were recorded at the Burrwood and Grand Isle C-MAN stations, respectively.  A wind gust of 62 mph was observed at a buoy in eastern Lake Pontchartrain near the Rigolets during a squall at 1510 CST on the 11th.  Significant tidal flooding occurred during the event with tides averaging 2 to 4 feet above normal along the southeast Louisiana coastline and in Lakes Pontchartrain and Maurepas.  The persistent strong winds and resulting high tides pushed a considerable amount of water into the tidal lakes of southeast Louisiana parishes and well inland along marshes, bayous, and other low-lying areas.  This resulted in a number of  homes outside of the levee protection systems being flooded and caused the flooding of many roadways.  The most severe flooding occurred in Terrebonne, Lafourche, and lower Jefferson Parishes.  Many businesses along the Harvey Canal in Jefferson Parish were damaged due to storm surge flooding,  and the levee along the canal was nearly overtopped.  In addition, very heavy rainfall occurred with most locations of southeast Louisiana receiving a minimum of 5 inches during the storm with some areas south of Lake Pontchartrain receiving 15 to 30 inches of rain.  The heavy rainfall resulted in widespread flash flooding south of Lake Pontchartrain.

The flash flooding peaked on September 11th when intense rainfall associated with a Tropical Storm Francis rainband resulted in rainfall amounts of 5 to 7 inches within a two to three hours period over portions of the greater New Orleans area.  By late afternoon, rainfall totals had reached from 8 to 12 inches.  Rainfall runoff overwhelmed drainage pumping capacity producing widespread and deep flooding in the streets of the New Orleans metropolitan area.  Ground transportation throughout much of Orleans Parish and portions of adjacent parishes was brought to a near standstill during the afternoon by the flooding, stranding many at work, school, or in autos.  The street flooding subsided during the evening. 

Around 800 homes and 30 businesses were flooded in Jefferson Parish from either storm surge flooding outside of the hurricane protection levees and flash flooding from heavy rainfall.  In Orleans Parish at least 290 single family homes and 124 apartments and businesses were flooded.  

A tornado developed in an outer rainband associated with Tropical Storm Francis on the evening of September 10th and followed a path approximately 4 miles long from near Cut Off to Larose killing a 22 year old male in a mobile home.  The most severe damage occurred in the first one half to three quarters mile of the path.

In addition, very heavy rainfall occurred with most locations of southeast Louisiana receiving a minimum of 5 inches during the storm with some areas south of Lake Pontchartrain receiving 15 to 30 inches of rain.  The heavy rainfall resulted in widespread flash flooding south of Lake Pontchartrain.

The flash flooding peaked on September 11th when intense rainfall associated with a Tropical Storm Francis rainband resulted in rainfall amounts of 5 to 7 inches within a two to three hours period over portions of the greater New Orleans area.  By late afternoon, rainfall totals had reached from 8 to 12 inches.  Rainfall runoff overwhelmed drainage pumping capacity producing widespread and deep flooding in the streets of the New Orleans metropolitan area.  Ground transportation throughout much of Orleans Parish and portions of adjacent parishes was brought to a near standstill during the afternoon by the flooding, stranding many at work, school, or in autos.  The street flooding subsided during the evening. 

Around 800 homes and 30 businesses were flooded in Jefferson Parish from either storm surge flooding outside of the hurricane protection levees and flash flooding from heavy rainfall.  In Orleans Parish at least 290 single family homes and 124 apartments and businesses were flooded.  

A tornado developed in an outer rainband associated with Tropical Storm Francis on the evening of September 10th and followed a path approximately 4 miles long from near Cut Off to Larose killing a 22 year old male in a mobile home.  The most severe damage occurred in the first one half to three quarters mile of the path.  Several mobile homes were destroyed, 3 conventional houses had roofs taken off, two houses were moved off their piling foundation, and two businesses suffered extensive damage.

The tropical storm moved steadily north across southeast Louisiana and by the afternoon of September 26 was located in central Mississippi downgraded to a tropical depression. Tropical Storm Isidore had a large circulation with tropical storm force winds extending several hundreds of miles from its center. Prior to moving onto the Yucatan Peninsula earlier in the week and weakening, Isidore was classified as a major hurricane.  Swells from the distant hurricane resulted in rip tides along the northern Gulf of Mexico, with a 41 year old man drowning on the afternoon of Sunday, Sept 22, 2002 at Port Fourchon, Lafouche Parish.   

 The large circulation caused a significant storm surge over a large area for a tropical storm. Tide levels were 4 to 6 feet above normal across much of southeast Louisiana from Grand Isle eastward to the Pearl River. Storm surge flooding occurred outside of the hurricane protection levees across Lafourche, Jefferson, Plaquemine, St. Bernard, and Orleans Parishes, inundating roadways and flooding some non-elevated structures. Across Lake Pontchartrain and Lake Maurepas, storm surge of 4 to 5 feet above normal were measured. Low lying areas, roadways and some non-elevated structures in parishes surrounding Lake Pontchartrain and Maurepas were flooded. St. Tammany Parish was particularly hard hit with storm surge flooding when the Isidore moved north of the area, and the winds shifted to a southwest direction causing water levels to rapidly increase along the north shore  of Lake Pontchartrain on the morning of Thursday, September 26, 2000. The storm surge overtopped or breached a small local levee system in southern portions of Slidell causing water to flood several hundred homes.   Approximately 1000 homes were flooded in the parish from either storm surge, river flooding, or from flooding from heavy rain

Rainbands associated with Tropical Storm Isidore produced heavy rainfall in a wide area prior to and shortly after landfall. The greater New Orleans area, was particularly hard hit on the late afternoon and early evening Wednesday, September 25, 2002. Four to eight inches of rainfall occurred within 6 hours time. Drainage systems were overwhelmed by the heavy rain and numerous streets were flooded, automobiles were flooded, and water entered some homes. Portions of Terrebonne and Lafourche Parishes were also hard hit during the early morning of Thursday, September 26, 2002 with homes flooded when heavy rainfall overwhelmed drainage. Between 200 and 300 homes and businesses were reported flooded in Terrebonne Parish. Storm total rainfall of 10 to 15 inches were common across southeast Louisiana. 

Most areas recorded sustained winds of 35 to 45 mph with some gusts to 50 mph in sqaulls. The highest wind speeds were observed near the coast or tidal lakes.  Grand Isle, on the coast, recorded the highest wind gust of 71 mph.

A tornado touched down near Golden Meadow, Lafourche Parish, where a couple of sheriff's office patrol cars were damaged along with several storage buildings.

The Louisiana Office of Emergency Preparedness reported appoximately 2500 people sought refuge in approximately 40 shelters in the state. 

As of late November 2002, the Louisiana State Insurance Department reported that insurance industry has indicated that Tropical Storm Isidore had  resulted in $105 million in insured losses. Approximately 166,200 claims had been filed with private insurance companies.

Approximately 1000 homes were flooded in the parish from either storm surge, river flooding, or from flooding from heavy rain

Rainbands associated with Tropical Storm Isidore produced heavy rainfall in a wide area prior to and shortly after landfall. The greater New Orleans area, was particularly hard hit on the late afternoon and early evening Wednesday, September 25, 2002. Four to eight inches of rainfall occurred within 6 hours time. Drainage systems were overwhelmed by the heavy rain and numerous streets were flooded, automobiles were flooded, and water entered some homes. Portions of Terrebonne and Lafourche Parishes were also hard hit during the early morning of Thursday, September 26, 2002 with homes flooded when heavy rainfall overwhelmed drainage. Between 200 and 300 homes and businesses were reported flooded in Terrebonne Parish. Storm total rainfall of 10 to 15 inches were common across southeast Louisiana. 

Most areas recorded sustained winds of 35 to 45 mph with some gusts to 50 mph in sqaulls. The highest wind speeds were observed near the coast or tidal lakes.  Grand Isle, on the coast, recorded the highest wind gust of 71 mph.

A tornado touched down near Golden Meadow, Lafourche Parish, where a couple of sheriff's office patrol cars were damaged along with several storage buildings.

The Louisiana Office of Emergency Preparedness reported appoximately 2500 people sought refuge in approximately 40 shelters in the state. 

As of late November 2002, the Louisiana State Insurance Department reported that insurance industry has indicated that Tropical Storm Isidore had  resulted in $105 million in insured losses. Approximately 166,200 claims had been filed with private insurance companies.
A reliable estimate of uninsured losses had not been determined as of the end of November 2002.

The tropical storm moved steadily north across southeast Louisiana and by the afternoon of September 26 was located in central Mississippi downgraded to a tropical depression. Tropical Storm Isidore had a large circulation with tropical storm force winds extending several hundreds of miles from its center. Prior to moving onto the Yucatan Peninsula earlier in the week and weakening, Isidore was classified as a major hurricane.  Swells from the distant hurricane resulted in rip tides along the northern Gulf of Mexico, with a 41 year old man drowning on the afternoon of Sunday, Sept 22, 2002 at Port Fourchon, Lafouche Parish.   

 The large circulation caused a significant storm surge over a large area for a tropical storm. Tide levels were 4 to 6 feet above normal across much of southeast Louisiana from Grand Isle eastward to the Pearl River. Storm surge flooding occurred outside of the hurricane protection levees across Lafourche, Jefferson, Plaquemine, St. Bernard, and Orleans Parishes, inundating roadways and flooding some non-elevated structures. Across Lake Pontchartrain and Lake Maurepas, storm surge of 4 to 5 feet above normal were measured. Low lying areas, roadways and some non-elevated structures in parishes surrounding Lake Pontchartrain and Maurepas were flooded. St. Tammany Parish was particularly hard hit with storm surge flooding when the Isidore moved north of the area, and the winds shifted to a southwest direction causing water levels to rapidly increase along the north shore  of Lake Pontchartrain on the morning of Thursday, September 26, 2000. The storm surge overtopped or breached a small local levee system in southern portions of Slidell causing water to flood several hundred homes.   Approximately 1000 homes were flooded in the parish from either storm surge, river flooding, or from flooding from heavy rain

Rainbands associated with Tropical Storm Isidore produced heavy rainfall in a wide area prior to and shortly after landfall. The greater New Orleans area, was particularly hard hit on the late afternoon and early evening Wednesday, September 25, 2002. Four to eight inches of rainfall occurred within 6 hours time. Drainage systems were overwhelmed by the heavy rain and numerous streets were flooded, automobiles were flooded, and water entered some homes. Portions of Terrebonne and Lafourche Parishes were also hard hit during the early morning of Thursday, September 26, 2002 with homes flooded when heavy rainfall overwhelmed drainage. Between 200 and 300 homes and businesses were reported flooded in Terrebonne Parish. Storm total rainfall of 10 to 15 inches were common across southeast Louisiana. 

Most areas recorded sustained winds of 35 to 45 mph with some gusts to 50 mph in sqaulls. The highest wind speeds were observed near the coast or tidal lakes.  Grand Isle, on the coast, recorded the highest wind gust of 71 mph.

Tropical Storm Bill moved into southeast Louisiana south of Houma around 2000CST on Monday, June 30, 2003 then moved north northeast across southeast Louisiana and at midnight was entering south Mississippi. The lowest pressure recorded in southeast Louisiana was 995.4 mb at the Louisiana Universities Marine Consortium (LUMCON) facility near Cocodrie. Storm surge of 3 to 5 feet above normal was common along the southeast Louisiana coast and Lake Pontchartrain. The maximum storm surge was 5.8 ft (datum NAVD88) at the LUMCON facility. Sustained winds of 35 to 45 mph were common across the area. The maximum one minute sustained wind was 48 kt (53 mph) at LUMCON and the maximum gust was 54 knots (62 mph) at the NWS automated wind gage at the north end of the Lake Pontchartrain Causeway in Mandeville. Storm total rainfall (approximately 48 hours) was 6 to 10 inches. The maximum measured rainfall was 10.16 inches at Folsom. Significant river flooding developed during the first five days of July as a result of the heavy rainfall and will be described in the July Storm Data. 

Three confirmed tornadoes touched down in southeast Louisiana. One of those tornadoes touched down near Reserve causing extensive damage to a private school and mobile home park. One woman and three small children were injured but fortunately, not seriously.  

The collective effects of Tropical Storm Bill in southeast Louisiana resulted in four injuries and approximately $44 million in property damage in the parishes of Jefferson, Livingston, Lafourche, Orleans, Plaquemine, St. Bernard, St. Charles, St. John the Baptist, St. Tammany, Tangiphahoa, and  Washington. Specifically, the three tornadoes resulted in 4 injuries and an estimated $2 million in property damage; property damage from from the strong winds was estimated at 31 million, storm surge flooding along the coast and tidal lakes caused 4.0 million in damage and heavy rainfall, river flooding, and flash flooding caused $7 million in damage. Damage estimates are based on the Louisiana Insurance Department's estimate of $22 million in insured losses (included FEMA flood insurance claims) increased by a factor of two to account for uninsured losses.","",93

Matthew made landfall as minimal tropical storm along the south central Louisiana coast near Cocodrie on October 10 and weakened to a tropical depression shortly after moving inland. Matthew continued north and moved across southeast Louisiana and southwest Mississippi as a tropical depression on the 10th before dissipating over extreme southeast Arkansas on October 11.

Tropical storm force winds associated with Matthew were mainly confined to the coastal areas of Terrebonne, Lafourche, Jefferson, and Plaquemines Parishes and around Lake Pontchartrain in the form of gusts. The highest sustained wind recorded in southeast Louisiana was at the NOAA automated weather station at the Southwest Pass of the Mississippi River with sustained winds of 42 knots (48 mph) with gusts to 48 knots (55 mph). The weather instruments at this location are located approximately 100 ft above sea level. The lowest pressure recorded was 999.7 mb at Tambour Bay on October 10th 0400 CST.

Most of the damage associated from Matthew was the result of a combination of heavy rain and coastal flooding. Rainfall amounts generally ranged from 5 to 10 inches with a few locations in Terrebonne, Lafourche and St. John the Baptist Parishes reporting amounts up to 13 to 16 inches. The storm surge was 2 to 4 feet above normal, but locally higher in some locations. The highest storm surge recorded was at Frenier on Lake Pontchartrain with a reading of 5.85 ft NGVD.  The greatest damage occurred in Terrebonne Parish where at estimated 20 homes sustained damage from heavy rain and storm surge in an area from Chauvin to Dulac, Montegut, and Pointe Aux Chene. In Lafourche several homes were flooded outside the flood gates from storm surge while within the flood gates several homes in Golden Meadow, Galliano, and Cutoff were flooded due to heavy rain. Law enforcement reported a brief tornado touchdown near Golden Meadow at 0349 CST on October 10th that tore half of the roof off of a trailer. Coastal flooding was observed around the shores of Lake Pontchartrain and Lake Maurepas and in most coastal areas outside of hurricane protection levees. Many roads were closed due to storm tide flooding in Lower Terrebonne, Lafourche, St. Bernard, and extreme eastern Orleans Parishes.  Several roads in Slidell and Mandeville in St. Tammany Parish and around Laplace in St. John the Baptist Parish were also flooded.

Matthew made landfall as minimal tropical storm along the south central Louisiana coast near Cocodrie on October 10 and weakened to a tropical depression shortly after moving inland. Matthew continued north and moved across southeast Louisiana and southwest Mississippi as a tropical depression on the 10th before dissipating over extreme southeast Arkansas on October 11.

Tropical storm force winds associated with Matthew were mainly confined to the coastal areas of Terrebonne, Lafourche, Jefferson, and Plaquemines Parishes and around Lake Pontchartrain in the form of gusts. The highest sustained wind recorded in southeast Louisiana was at the NOAA automated weather station at the Southwest Pass of the Mississippi River with sustained winds of 42 knots (48 mph) with gusts to 48 knots (55 mph). The weather instruments at this location are located approximately 100 ft above sea level. The lowest pressure recorded was 999.7 mb at Tambour Bay on October 10th 0400 CST.

Most of the damage associated from Matthew was the result of a combination of heavy rain and coastal flooding. Rainfall amounts generally ranged from 5 to 10 inches with a few locations in Terrebonne, Lafourche and St. John the Baptist Parishes reporting amounts up to 13 to 16 inches. The storm surge was 2 to 4 feet above normal, but locally higher in some locations. The highest storm surge recorded was at Frenier on Lake Pontchartrain with a reading of 5.85 ft NGVD.  The greatest damage occurred in Terrebonne Parish where at estimated 20 homes sustained damage from heavy rain and storm surge in an area from Chauvin to Dulac, Montegut, and Pointe Aux Chene. In Lafourche several homes were flooded outside the flood gates from storm surge while within the flood gates several homes in Golden Meadow, Galliano, and Cutoff were flooded due to heavy rain. Law enforcement reported a brief tornado touchdown near Golden Meadow at 0349 CST on October 10th that tore half of the roof off of a trailer. Coastal flooding was observed around the shores of Lake Pontchartrain and Lake Maurepas and in most coastal areas outside of hurricane protection levees. Many roads were closed due to storm tide flooding in Lower Terrebonne, Lafourche, St. Bernard, and extreme eastern Orleans Parishes.

Across southeast Louisiana, the main affect from Hurricane Rita was the substantial storm surge flooding that occurred in low lying communities across coastal areas of southern Terrebonne, southern Lafourche, and southern Jefferson Parishes where numerous homes and businesses were flooded. Some of the most substantial damage occurred in southern Terrebonne Parish where storm surge of 5 to 7 feet above normal overtopped or breached local drainage levees inundating many small communities. Newspaper accounts indicated approximately 10,000 structures were flooded in Terrebonne Parish. Lafitte and other communities in lower Jefferson Parish also suffered extensive storm surge flooding. Storm surge flooding also occurred in areas adjacent to Lake Pontchartrain and Lake Maurepas with some homes and businesses flooded from Slidell to Mandeville and Madisonville. Approximately 1500 structures were reported flooded in Livingston Parish near Lake Maurepas.

Locally higher storm surge values may have occurred in Terrebonne Parish.

Across southeast Louisiana, the main affect from Hurricane Rita was the substantial storm surge flooding that occurred in low lying communities across coastal areas of southern Terrebonne, southern Lafourche, and southern Jefferson Parishes where numerous homes and businesses were flooded. Some of the most substantial damage occurred in southern Terrebonne Parish where storm surge of 5 to 7 feet above normal overtopped or breached local drainage levees inundating many small communities. Newspaper accounts indicated approximately 10,000 structures were flooded in Terrebonne Parish. Lafitte and other communities in lower Jefferson Parish also suffered extensive storm surge flooding. Storm surge flooding also occurred in areas adjacent to Lake Pontchartrain and Lake Maurepas with some homes and businesses flooded from Slidell to Mandeville and Madisonville. Approximately 1500 structures were reported flooded in Livingston Parish near Lake Maurepas. Repaired levees damaged by Hurricane Katrina in late August were overtopped or breached along the Industrial Canal in New Orleans resulting in renewed flooding in adjacent portions of New Orleans and St. Bernard Parish, although the flooding was much more limited in areal coverage than during Hurricane Katrina.  The highest tide gage readings measured during the storm was 7.34 feet NGVD at Barataria Bay north of Grand Isle at 11 PM CDT on September 23rd, and approximately 7.10 feet NGVD on Bayou Grand Cailliou at Dulac at 0500 CDT on September 24th. Locally higher storm surge values may have occurred in Terrebonne Parish.

Although minimal sustained tropical storm force winds were observed across western sections of southeast Louisiana from the Baton Rouge area south to the coast, most of the tropical storm force winds were confined to occasional gusts in squalls associated with the storm.  The maximum sustained wind recorded in southeast Louisiana was 42 mph (36 knots) at the Baton Rouge Airport at 1043 am CDT on September 24th.  The maximum wind gust was also recorded at this station with 53 mph (46 knots) occurring at 1006 pm CDT on the 23rd and 948 am CDT on the 24th.

Rainfall amounts were the heaviest across western areas of southeast Louisiana between the Atchafalaya River and Lake Maurepas where totals generally ranged from 6 to 12 inches.

Rita turned northwest and weakened to a category 3 hurricane on the 23rd and made  landfall around 230 AM CDT on September 24th just east of the Texas and Louisiana border between Sabine Pass and Johnson's Bayou as a category 3 storm with maximum sustained winds of 120 mph.

Across southeast Louisiana, the main affect from Hurricane Rita was the substantial storm surge flooding that occurred in low lying communities across coastal areas of southern Terrebonne, southern Lafourche, and southern Jefferson Parishes where numerous homes and businesses were flooded. Some of the most substantial damage occurred in southern Terrebonne Parish where storm surge of 5 to 7 feet above normal overtopped or breached local drainage levees inundating many small communities. Newspaper accounts indicated approximately 10,000 structures were flooded in Terrebonne Parish. Lafitte and other communities in lower Jefferson Parish also suffered extensive storm surge flooding. Storm surge flooding also occurred in areas adjacent to Lake Pontchartrain and Lake Maurepas with some homes and businesses flooded from Slidell to Mandeville and Madisonville. Approximately 1500 structures were reported flooded in Livingston Parish near Lake Maurepas. Repaired levees damaged by Hurricane Katrina in late August were overtopped or breached along the Industrial Canal in New Orleans resulting in renewed flooding in adjacent portions of New Orleans and St. Bernard Parish, although the flooding was much more limited in areal coverage than during Hurricane Katrina.  The highest tide gage readings measured during the storm was 7.34 feet NGVD at Barataria Bay north of Grand Isle at 11 PM CDT on September 23rd, and approximately 7.10 feet NGVD on Bayou Grand Cailliou at Dulac at 0500 CDT on September 24th. Locally higher storm surge values may have occurred in Terrebonne Parish.

Although minimal sustained tropical storm force winds were observed across western sections of southeast Louisiana from the Baton Rouge area south to the coast, most of the tropical storm force winds were confined to occasional gusts in squalls associated with the storm.  The maximum sustained wind recorded in southeast Louisiana was 42 mph (36 knots) at the Baton Rouge Airport at 1043 am CDT on September 24th.  The maximum wind gust was also recorded at this station with 53 mph (46 knots) occurring at 1006 pm CDT on the 23rd and 948 am CDT on the 24th.

Across southeast Louisiana, the main affect from Hurricane Rita was the substantial storm surge flooding that occurred in low lying communities across coastal areas of southern Terrebonne, southern Lafourche, and southern Jefferson Parishes where numerous homes and businesses were flooded. Some of the most substantial damage occurred in southern Terrebonne Parish where storm surge of 5 to 7 feet above normal overtopped or breached local drainage levees inundating many small communities. Newspaper accounts indicated approximately 10,000 structures were flooded in Terrebonne Parish. Lafitte and other communities in lower Jefferson Parish also suffered extensive storm surge flooding. Storm surge flooding also occurred in areas adjacent to Lake Pontchartrain and Lake Maurepas with some homes and businesses flooded from Slidell to Mandeville and Madisonville. Approximately 1500 structures were reported flooded in Livingston Parish near Lake Maurepas. Repaired levees damaged by Hurricane Katrina in late August were overtopped or breached along the Industrial Canal in New Orleans resulting in renewed flooding in adjacent portions of New Orleans and St. Bernard Parish, although the flooding was much more limited in areal coverage than during Hurricane Katrina.  The highest tide gage readings measured during the storm was 7.34 feet NGVD at Barataria Bay north of Grand Isle at 11 PM CDT on September 23rd, and approximately 7.10 feet NGVD on Bayou Grand Cailliou at Dulac at 0500 CDT on September 24th. Locally higher storm surge values may have occurred in Terrebonne Parish.

Although minimal sustained tropical storm force winds were observed across western sections of southeast Louisiana from the Baton Rouge area south to the coast, most of the tropical storm force winds were confined to occasional gusts in squalls associated with the storm.  The maximum sustained wind recorded in southeast Louisiana was 42 mph (36 knots) at the Baton Rouge Airport at 1043 am CDT on September 24th.

The highest measured wind gusts were 85 mph at a research site near Abbeville, LA in Vermilion Parish. However, wind speeds were estimated between 75 and 85 mph from St. Mary Parish to Evangeline Parish.||Storm surge was a minimal impact because southwest Louisiana was on the west side of the onshore winds for most of the event. The highest recorded storm tide was 4.77 at Amerada Pass in St. Mary Parish.||However, rainfall was a large impact. In central Louisiana, over 20 inches of rain fell in Rapides Parish, with a CO-OP observer recording 20.43 inches 7 miles east of Alexandria. This resulted in widespread flooding of the Alexandria-Pineville region, where over 200 water rescues were performed. Significant flooding also occurred in New Iberia, where over ten inches of rain fell, resulting in widespread flooding in and around New Iberia.||Several tornadoes were seen across southwest Louisiana, with the worst one occurring in Evangeline Parish near Mamou, where two people were killed when their tied-down mobile home was thrown for over 200 yards.||Other fatalities in the region were considered indirect. Two men died in Calcasieu Parish from carbon monoxide poisoning from a generator running in their home. A woman died in St. Martin Parish when her home caught fire from burning candles after she lost power.||Total property damages were estimated near 750 million dollars in southwest Louisiana.

Mainly tropical storm force wind gusts associated with Ike affected southeast Louisiana although sustained tropical storm winds were measured near the coast. The main effect of Ike on southeast Louisiana was the storm surge which inundated sections of the coast, especially Terrebonne and Lafourche Parish. ||A storm surge ranging from 4 to nearly 8 feet above normal along the southeast Louisiana coast with a storm surge around 5 feet above normal in Lake Pontchartrain. The unusually high storm surge generated by the distant hurricane affected many low-lying coastal areas as well as areas around Lake Pontchartrain, but federal levees protected most of the high density population areas of greater New Orleans. Some locally built levees were breached or overtopped, most notably in southern Terrebonne Parish where 2,500 homes out of the 15,000 homes in the affected area were flooded. In southern Jefferson Parish from Lafitte and Crown Point to Grand Isle, approximately 2,500 structures were flooded. Considerable storm surge flooding was noted around Lakes Pontchartrain and Maurepas. Around 200 structures were flooded in St Tammany Parish from Slidell to Mandeville and Madisonville. The storm surge flooding took several weeks to fully drain from many low lying areas of southeast Louisiana. Louisiana Economic Development office estimated that Ike caused insured and uninsured property damage of at least $3.5 billion in the state of Louisiana.||The highest wind gust recorded in southeast Louisiana was 69 mph at the New Orleans Lakefront Airport ASOS site during a squall while the highest sustained wind of 55 mph was recorded at the Pilot's Station East CMAN site near Southwest Pass; however, due to the failure of equipment at some observation sites during the storm higher winds may have occurred.

Twelve hours later, Tropical Depression Nine had strengthened into Tropical Storm Isaac. Isaac continued to track through the eastern Caribbean Sea and Florida Straits while maintaining high end tropical storm strength. Just before noon central time on the 28th, Isaac was located about 75 miles south-southeast of the mouth of the Mississippi River(or about 160 miles southeast of New Orleans) and was found to have reached hurricane strength with winds of 75 mph. An outer rain band from Isaac brought some showers to portions of the ArkLaMiss during the afternoon of the 28th, while the center of Isaac was still churning in the Gulf of Mexico. At 6:45pm on August 28th, Hurricane Isaac made a brief landfall along the coast of Southeast Louisiana in Plaquemines Parish. Maximum sustained winds were 80mph at this landfall. Isaac did not remain over land for long as he was back over water again by 9:00pm that same evening. Isaac made his second landfall along the coast of southeast Louisiana, just to the west of Port Fourchon, around 2:15am August 29th, again with maximum sustained winds of 80 mph.||Isaac moved very slowly to the north and northwest over the course of August 29th, which made for prolonged impacts. Forward motion of about 5 mph lead to tremendous flooding issues for both Louisiana and portions of Mississippi south of I-20. Around noon on August 29th, Isaac was downgraded to a Tropical Storm, but this was not much relief to the many residents who were being inundated with rain and wind. Storm total rainfall across portions of Marion County indicated at least 10 to 15 inches fell. Numerous homes and buildings were flooded and some water rescues occurred in Lamar, Marion and Clarke counties. Further to the north, flooding issues were not quite as bad with about 5 to 7 inches of rain falling from the I-20 corridor and north. Tropical storm force wind gusts were noted as far north as Bolivar County, with the Golden Triangle region not seeing winds reach more than tropical depression strength. The worst of the wind was felt generally along and south of an axis from Marion County to Adams County. Numerous trees were down in Adams County, leaving many without power for several days. Eighty percent of the roads were blocked in Franklin County due to downed trees.||With all of the rain that fell, some of the area rivers filled quickly. Minor flooding was recorded on the lower Pearl River at Rockport and Monticello, as well as on Bouie Creek at Hattiesburg and Tallahala Creek at Laurel. The biggest river impact in the Jackson Hydrologic Service Area was on Black Creek at Brooklyn. Black Creek entered moderate flooding and finally crested at 26.71 feet on August 31st at 5pm. This will go down as the second highest crest in history for this particular river and forecast point. This river flooding caused damage to 15 homes both upstream and downstream of the river gage.||The winds and flooding were not all Isaac brought as a couple of tornadoes touched down in eastern Mississippi. Two tornadoes, one in Clarke County and one in Lauderdale County, occurred during the morning of August 30th. Both were rated EF-1 with winds around 100 mph. The tornado in Clarke County, near Crandall, resulted in 3 injuries to residents of a mobile home. One death attributed to Isaac occurred in Holmes County when a 64 year old woman was killed by a tree falling on her car.

Impacts from Laura were felt far from the center of the storm, which was mainly in the form of tropical storm force winds across portions of northeast Louisiana and southeast Arkansas. Farther east, into Mississippi, the tight pressure gradient that resulted from Laura was the cause for gusty winds across portions of western Mississippi. Winds were sustained 30 to 35 mph, gusting to 45 to 49 mph across portions of northeast Louisiana, southeast Arkansas and the northwest portion of Mississippi.
