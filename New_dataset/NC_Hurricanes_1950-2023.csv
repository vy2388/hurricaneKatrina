The slow moving hurricane initially crossed Cape Fear during the late afternoon on the 26th, then pivoted northeast along the North Carolina coast during the evening. With part of the circulation center on land, the storm weakened to Catagory I storm in the early morning hours of the 27th before making landfall near the Onslow/Pender county line. The storm then continued to move slowly northeast at speeds of 10 mph or less. Bonnie was downgraded to a Tropical Storm during the afternoon of the 27th but later was reclassified as a Hurricane as she moved off Kitty Hawk late in the evening. Bonnie was a unique storm in that the strongest winds were not located around the center of circulation like a typical hurricane but encompassed a large area in the eastern semi-circle. The most damaging winds were contained in the precursor rain bands where localized downbursts produced siginficant damage...especially along the coast of Carteret county which appeared to sustain the most damage from the storm. The slow movement of the storm contributed to excessive rainfall amounts with totals of 7-10 inches common across eastern North Carolina. Since much of the region had experienced below normal rainfall during the  summer months,  the resulting flood was not as damaging as it could have been. The Southeast Cape Fear River in Duplin county had the most significant flooding with areas near Chinquapin reporting high water. Elsewhere flooding of poor drainage and low lying areas predominated.

Along the Outer Banks, soundside flooding from the Pamlico Sound late on the 27th and early on the 28th produced water levels 4-6 feet above normal in Manteo on Roanoke Island and over portions of Hatteras Island where Route 12 was closed briefly due to high water. Storm surge at the beaches of Onslow and Carteret counties was generally 3-5 feet above normal with moderate beach erosion. North Topsail Beach lost most of the protective dunes constructed after the hurricanes of 1996. Tens of thousands of tires, part of an artificial reef,  washed up on the shore of Bogue Banks.

The Iron Steamer and Indian Beach piers sustained significant damage losing large sections due to the combination of wind and rough surf. The hurricane also produced 7 confirmed tornadoes during the afternoon and evening of the 26th.

Bonnie was a unique storm in that the strongest winds were not located around the center of circulation like a typical hurricane but encompassed a large area in the eastern semi-circle. The most damaging winds were contained in the precursor rain bands where localized downbursts produced siginficant damage...especially along the coast of Carteret county which appeared to sustain the most damage from the storm. The slow movement of the storm contributed to excessive rainfall amounts with totals of 7-10 inches common across eastern North Carolina. Since much of the region had experienced below normal rainfall during the  summer months,  the resulting flood was not as damaging as it could have been. The Southeast Cape Fear River in Duplin county had the most significant flooding with areas near Chinquapin reporting high water. Elsewhere flooding of poor drainage and low lying areas predominated. Coastal/Storm surge flooding  was not  as extensive as with Huuricanes Fran or Bertha but several locations did report significant problems. The hardest hit area was Belhaven where storm surge flooding along the Pungo River flooded 2/3rds of the homes in the area with water levels as high as 6 ft above normal. Other coastal flooding was reported in Manns Harbor and Stumpy Point in Dare county, Washington in Beaufort county, Near Hobucken in Pamlico county, Swansboro in Onslow county and along the south shore of the Albemarle sound in Washington and Tyrrell counties. Many docks, piers and bulkheads were damaged or destroyed by the storm. Along the Outer Banks, soundside flooding from the Pamlico Sound late on the 27th and early on the 28th produced water levels 4-6 feet above normal in Manteo on Roanoke Island and over portions of Hatteras Island where Route 12 was closed briefly due to high water. Storm surge at the beaches of Onslow and Carteret counties was generally 3-5 feet above normal with moderate beach erosion. North Topsail Beach lost most of the protective dunes constructed after the hurricanes of 1996. Tens of thousands of tires, part of an artificial reef,  washed up on the shore of Bogue Banks.

He also caused massive record flooding across inland sections of eastern North Carolina.  At one time Floyd was classified as a category 4 hurricane on the Saffir/Simpson scale and will likely be categorized as one of the nation's most costly hurricanes in the 20th century.

Tropical Depression number eight was detected by the National Hurricane Center at 1600 EST on September 7th.  The broad center was nearly 1000 miles west of the Lesser Antilles.  At that time the depression was moving toward the west at 14 mph with maximum sustained winds of 30 mph.  Within 12 hours the depression gained strength, became a tropical storm, and was named Floyd.  As it neared the Virgin Islands on the afternoon of September 10th just 415 miles west of San Juan, Floyd became a hurricane.  Hurricane Floyd rapidly intensified and by the evening of September 12th was classified as a category 4 hurricane.  The hurricane continued to intensify.  At its peak on the morning of September 13th, the winds increased to 155 mph and the central pressure bottomed-out at 921 mb.  The position was 525 miles east-southeast of Miami and moving west at 14 mph.  

Fortunately for Floridians, Hurricane Floyd soon made the expected turn to the north.  By 1700 EST on September 14th the entire North Carolina coast was under a hurricane watch and at midnight up-graded to a hurricane warning.  That same night the first outer rainbands began affecting eastern North Carolina and in turn, reports of flooding began filtering into the National Weather Service office in Morehead City/Newport (MHX).  At least 40 official shelters were open across the county warning area.

Severe weather and rainfall preceded landfall.  By Wednesday night September 16th, 20 tornado warnings had been issued with over half being verified.  The greatest rainfall estimates from the MHX Doppler radar were over Duplin...Jones...Lenoir...Greene...Pitt...Martin...Craven...and Onslow Counties.  Estimates were near 6 to 10 inches with isolated areas of 12 to 15 inches.  The greatest rainfall report was from a Cooperative observer in Washington...15.48 inches. Tyrrell...eastern Carteret...eastern Pamlico... Hyde...and Dare Counties all had estimates less than 3 inches.  

Hurricane Floyd made landfall on the morning of September 16th near North Topsail Beach as a category 2 hurricane.  The eye moved northeast over Jacksonville...New Bern...Washington...Plymouth and continued over the eastern shores of Virginia.  As the hurricane moved over the eastern coast of North Carolina, it accelerated and weakened.  It lost its tropical characteristics early on the 17th.  The University of Oklahoma Doppler-On-Wheels (DOW) team was positioned at Topsail Beach.  Around 0200 EST the DOW recorded a sustained wind of 81 mph with gusts to 105 mph.  The peak inland report in the MHX 15-county warning area was 82 mph at Cherry Point Marine Corp Air Station (NKT).  The peak offshore report was 96 mph at Duck Pier.

Similar to rainfall, the strongest ocean storm surges occurred west and northwest of the eye.  Ocean storm surges were about 4 to 6 feet above normal...generally affecting Onslow...Carteret...and Hyde Counties.  This caused extensive beach erosion on the south facing beaches.  Ocracoke Island officials reported at least 10 new dune breaks along Highway 12.  In Carteret County Pine Knoll Shores lost some 50 feet of beach.  Emerald Isle lost an average of 14 feet and 52 public beach access walkways.  The Oceanana Pier on Atlantic Beach lost a 200 foot section and the remaining 200 foot section of Iron Steamer Pier that Hurricane Bonnie spared was also wiped out.

Along the Albemarle Sound...storm tides were about 5 to 6 feet above normal.  The Pamlico River storm tides were around 6 to 8 feet above normal.  Water levels were especially high in Hyde County...Sladesville and Scranton.  Along the Neuse River storm tides were also near 6 to 8 feet above normal...especially in the Core Creek area.

Extreme flooding was experienced across most counties.  Inland flooding exceeded Hurricane Bertha...Fran...Bonnie... and Dennis combined.  Most counties reported their worst flooding ever.  The Tar River in Greenville and the Neuse River in Kinston were nearly 15 feet above their flood stages of 13 and 14 feet, respectively.  The Tar River remained above flood stage for nearly two weeks while the Neuse River remained above flood stage for over a month.  The Northeast Cape Fear River in Chinquapin was 8 to 10 feet above the flood stage of 13 feet.  The Roanoke River in Williamston rose to nearly 3 feet above its flood stage.  Unbelievable numbers of homes were covered with water and over half a million customers throughout the county warning area were without power.  In Greenville alone a 100 acre parcel of land would be needed to store all the mobile homes that were destroyed due to flooding.  Unofficially the flooding from Hurricane Floyd has been compared to a 500 year flood.  At least 13 fatalities have been reported during the event in the 15 county warning area.  Unfortunately, a majority of the deaths could have been avoided had the victims not driven through flooded roadways.

By 1700 EST on September 14th the entire North Carolina coast was under a hurricane watch and at midnight up-graded to a hurricane warning.  That same night the first outer rainbands began affecting eastern North Carolina and in turn, reports of flooding began filtering into the National Weather Service office in Morehead City/Newport (MHX).  At least 40 official shelters were open across the county warning area.

Severe weather and rainfall preceded landfall.  By Wednesday night September 16th, 20 tornado warnings had been issued with over half being verified.  The greatest rainfall estimates from the MHX Doppler radar were over Duplin...Jones...Lenoir...Greene...Pitt...Martin...Craven...and Onslow Counties.  Estimates were near 6 to 10 inches with isolated areas of 12 to 15 inches.  The greatest rainfall report was from a Cooperative observer in Washington...15.48 inches. Tyrrell...eastern Carteret...eastern Pamlico... Hyde...and Dare Counties all had estimates less than 3 inches.  

Hurricane Floyd made landfall on the morning of September 16th near North Topsail Beach as a category 2 hurricane.  The eye moved northeast over Jacksonville...New Bern...Washington...Plymouth and continued over the eastern shores of Virginia.  As the hurricane moved over the eastern coast of North Carolina, it accelerated and weakened.  It lost its tropical characteristics early on the 17th.  The University of Oklahoma Doppler-On-Wheels (DOW) team was positioned at Topsail Beach.  Around 0200 EST the DOW recorded a sustained wind of 81 mph with gusts to 105 mph.  The peak inland report in the MHX 15-county warning area was 82 mph at Cherry Point Marine Corp Air Station (NKT).  The peak offshore report was 96 mph at Duck Pier.

Similar to rainfall, the strongest ocean storm surges occurred west and northwest of the eye.  Ocean storm surges were about 4 to 6 feet above normal...generally affecting Onslow...Carteret...and Hyde Counties.  This caused extensive beach erosion on the south facing beaches.  Ocracoke Island officials reported at least 10 new dune breaks along Highway 12.  In Carteret County Pine Knoll Shores lost some 50 feet of beach.  Emerald Isle lost an average of 14 feet and 52 public beach access walkways.  The Oceanana Pier on Atlantic Beach lost a 200 foot section and the remaining 200 foot section of Iron Steamer Pier that Hurricane Bonnie spared was also wiped out.

Along the Albemarle Sound...storm tides were about 5 to 6 feet above normal.  The Pamlico River storm tides were around 6 to 8 feet above normal.  Water levels were especially high in Hyde County...Sladesville and Scranton.  Along the Neuse River storm tides were also near 6 to 8 feet above normal...especially in the Core Creek area.

Extreme flooding was experienced across most counties.  Inland flooding exceeded Hurricane Bertha...Fran...Bonnie... and Dennis combined.  Most counties reported their worst flooding ever.  The Tar River in Greenville and the Neuse River in Kinston were nearly 15 feet above their flood stages of 13 and 14 feet, respectively.  The Tar River remained above flood stage for nearly two weeks while the Neuse River remained above flood stage for over a month.  The Northeast Cape Fear River in Chinquapin was 8 to 10 feet above the flood stage of 13 feet.  The Roanoke River in Williamston rose to nearly 3 feet above its flood stage.  Unbelievable numbers of homes were covered with water and over half a million customers throughout the county warning area were without power.  In Greenville alone a 100 acre parcel of land would be needed to store all the mobile homes that were destroyed due to flooding.  Unofficially the flooding from Hurricane Floyd has been compared to a 500 year flood.  At least 13 fatalities have been reported during the event in the 15 county warning area.  Unfortunately, a majority of the deaths could have been avoided had the victims not driven through flooded roadways.

He also caused massive record flooding across inland sections of eastern North Carolina.  At one time Floyd was classified as a category 4 hurricane on the Saffir/Simpson scale and will likely be categorized as one of the nation's most costly hurricanes in the 20th century.

Tropical Depression number eight was detected by the National Hurricane Center at 1600 EST on September 7th.  The broad center was nearly 1000 miles west of the Lesser Antilles.  At that time the depression was moving toward the west at 14 mph with maximum sustained winds of 30 mph.  Within 12 hours the depression gained strength, became a tropical storm, and was named Floyd.  As it neared the Virgin Islands on the afternoon of September 10th just 415 miles west of San Juan, Floyd became a hurricane.  Hurricane Floyd rapidly intensified and by the evening of September 12th was classified as a category 4 hurricane.  The hurricane continued to intensify.  At its peak on the morning of September 13th, the winds increased to 155 mph and the central pressure bottomed-out at 921 mb.  The position was 525 miles east-southeast of Miami and moving west at 14 mph.  

Fortunately for Floridians, Hurricane Floyd soon made the expected turn to the north.  By 1700 EST on September 14th the entire North Carolina coast was under a hurricane watch and at midnight up-graded to a hurricane warning.  That same night the first outer rainbands began affecting eastern North Carolina and in turn, reports of flooding began filtering into the National Weather Service office in Morehead City/Newport (MHX).  At least 40 official shelters were open across the county warning area.

Severe weather and rainfall preceded landfall.  By Wednesday night September 16th, 20 tornado warnings had been issued with over half being verified.  The greatest rainfall estimates from the MHX Doppler radar were over Duplin...Jones...Lenoir...Greene...Pitt...Martin...Craven...and Onslow Counties.  Estimates were near 6 to 10 inches with isolated areas of 12 to 15 inches.  The greatest rainfall report was from a Cooperative observer in Washington...15.48 inches. Tyrrell...eastern Carteret...eastern Pamlico... Hyde...and Dare Counties all had estimates less than 3 inches.  

Hurricane Floyd made landfall on the morning of September 16th near North Topsail Beach as a category 2 hurricane.  The eye moved northeast over Jacksonville...New Bern...Washington...Plymouth and continued over the eastern shores of Virginia.  As the hurricane moved over the eastern coast of North Carolina, it accelerated and weakened.  It lost its tropical characteristics early on the 17th.  The University of Oklahoma Doppler-On-Wheels (DOW) team was positioned at Topsail Beach.  Around 0200 EST the DOW recorded a sustained wind of 81 mph with gusts to 105 mph.  The peak inland report in the MHX 15-county warning area was 82 mph at Cherry Point Marine Corp Air Station (NKT).  The peak offshore report was 96 mph at Duck Pier.

Similar to rainfall, the strongest ocean storm surges occurred west and northwest of the eye.  Ocean storm surges were about 4 to 6 feet above normal...generally affecting Onslow...Carteret...and Hyde Counties.  This caused extensive beach erosion on the south facing beaches.  Ocracoke Island officials reported at least 10 new dune breaks along Highway 12.  In Carteret County Pine Knoll Shores lost some 50 feet of beach.  Emerald Isle lost an average of 14 feet and 52 public beach access walkways.  The Oceanana Pier on Atlantic Beach lost a 200 foot section and the remaining 200 foot section of Iron Steamer Pier that Hurricane Bonnie spared was also wiped out.

Along the Albemarle Sound...storm tides were about 5 to 6 feet above normal.  The Pamlico River storm tides were around 6 to 8 feet above normal.  Water levels were especially high in Hyde County...Sladesville and Scranton.  Along the Neuse River storm tides were also near 6 to 8 feet above normal...especially in the Core Creek area.

Extreme flooding was experienced across most counties.  Inland flooding exceeded Hurricane Bertha...Fran...Bonnie... and Dennis combined.  Most counties reported their worst flooding ever.  The Tar River in Greenville and the Neuse River in Kinston were nearly 15 feet above their flood stages of 13 and 14 feet, respectively.  The Tar River remained above flood stage for nearly two weeks while the Neuse River remained above flood stage for over a month.  The Northeast Cape Fear River in Chinquapin was 8 to 10 feet above the flood stage of 13 feet.  The Roanoke River in Williamston rose to nearly 3 feet above its flood stage.  Unbelievable numbers of homes were covered with water and over half a million customers throughout the county warning area were without power.  In Greenville alone a 100 acre parcel of land would be needed to store all the mobile homes that were destroyed due to flooding.

He also caused massive record flooding across inland sections of eastern North Carolina.  At one time Floyd was classified as a category 4 hurricane on the Saffir/Simpson scale and will likely be categorized as one of the nation's most costly hurricanes in the 20th century.

Tropical Depression number eight was detected by the National Hurricane Center at 1600 EST on September 7th.  The broad center was nearly 1000 miles west of the Lesser Antilles.  At that time the depression was moving toward the west at 14 mph with maximum sustained winds of 30 mph.  Within 12 hours the depression gained strength, became a tropical storm, and was named Floyd.  As it neared the Virgin Islands on the afternoon of September 10th just 415 miles west of San Juan, Floyd became a hurricane.  Hurricane Floyd rapidly intensified and by the evening of September 12th was classified as a category 4 hurricane.  The hurricane continued to intensify.  At its peak on the morning of September 13th, the winds increased to 155 mph and the central pressure bottomed-out at 921 mb.  The position was 525 miles east-southeast of Miami and moving west at 14 mph.  

Fortunately for Floridians, Hurricane Floyd soon made the expected turn to the north.  By 1700 EST on September 14th the entire North Carolina coast was under a hurricane watch and at midnight up-graded to a hurricane warning.  That same night the first outer rainbands began affecting eastern North Carolina and in turn, reports of flooding began filtering into the National Weather Service office in Morehead City/Newport (MHX).  At least 40 official shelters were open across the county warning area.

Severe weather and rainfall preceded landfall.  By Wednesday night September 16th, 20 tornado warnings had been issued with over half being verified.  The greatest rainfall estimates from the MHX Doppler radar were over Duplin...Jones...Lenoir...Greene...Pitt...Martin...Craven...and Onslow Counties.  Estimates were near 6 to 10 inches with isolated areas of 12 to 15 inches.  The greatest rainfall report was from a Cooperative observer in Washington...15.48 inches. Tyrrell...eastern Carteret...eastern Pamlico... Hyde...and Dare Counties all had estimates less than 3 inches.  

Hurricane Floyd made landfall on the morning of September 16th near North Topsail Beach as a category 2 hurricane.  The eye moved northeast over Jacksonville...New Bern...Washington...Plymouth and continued over the eastern shores of Virginia.  As the hurricane moved over the eastern coast of North Carolina, it accelerated and weakened.  It lost its tropical characteristics early on the 17th.  The University of Oklahoma Doppler-On-Wheels (DOW) team was positioned at Topsail Beach.  Around 0200 EST the DOW recorded a sustained wind of 81 mph with gusts to 105 mph.  The peak inland report in the MHX 15-county warning area was 82 mph at Cherry Point Marine Corp Air Station (NKT).  The peak offshore report was 96 mph at Duck Pier.

Similar to rainfall, the strongest ocean storm surges occurred west and northwest of the eye.  Ocean storm surges were about 4 to 6 feet above normal...generally affecting Onslow...Carteret...and Hyde Counties.  This caused extensive beach erosion on the south facing beaches.  Ocracoke Island officials reported at least 10 new dune breaks along Highway 12.  In Carteret County Pine Knoll Shores lost some 50 feet of beach.  Emerald Isle lost an average of 14 feet and 52 public beach access walkways.

As she crossed the southern Florida Peninsula, winds slightly weakened.  Saturday morning Hurricane Irene moved offshore over the  warm Atlantic Gulf Stream water.  At the same time, the hurricane watches were extended north to include Cape Hatteras south.  Irene was undoubtedly going to threaten the Carolinas.  By Saturday afternoon the watch was upgraded to a warning with tropical storm warnings for north of Cape Hatteras.

Fortunately, the category 1 hurricane paralleled the coast of eastern North Carolina.  Since the eye remained offshore so did the hurricane force winds.  In turn, storm surges were insignificant.  Very minor beach erosion was experienced along the beaches in Onslow County and along Bogue Banks in Carteret County.  The highest  offshore wind was 67 mph...observed at Diamond Shoals C-Man platform.  The peak  inland wind reported was 47 mph at Cape Hatteras/Frisco.  One F0 tornado was reported in Onslow County near the intersection of Highway 24 and Highway 17...causing only minor damage.

Rainfall again played the largest role during the event.  The greatest rainfall estimates from the Doppler radar were over Craven...Pitt...Beaufort...Martin...Dare...and Hyde counties.  Estimates were from 4 to 6 inches with isolated areas receiving 8 to 10 inches.  A spotter reported 11 inches in Ernul/Craven County on the 17th and 18th.  This excessive rainfall caused many road closures and some areas in Lenoir County reported a foot of water on secondary roads.  No significant damage was reported from Hurricane Irene.  One fatality was reported in western Beaufort County.  A male was driving an automobile on Highway 264 when the vehicle hydroplaned.  Craven and Lenoir Counties were obviously the most affected.  River levels remained above flood stage on the Neuse River since before Hurricane Floyd.

The storm crossed Florida, and exited the coast as a category one.  It continued northeast and made landfall again near Cape Romain as a weak category one hurricane with sustained winds at 75 mph. It moved up the coast and then inland around Myrtle Beach.  In Horry and Georgetown counties, insurance claims totaled $5 million, mostly along the Grand Strand.  There were downed trees, roof damage, and flooding along the coast in this area.  65,000 residents lost power, and the estimate for cleanup in Georgetown county alone was $1.5 million. As Charley moved northeast, Brunswick county was hit the hardest, with peak winds around 85 mph.    Damage was extensive, with 2231 homes damaged, 231 with major damage, and 40 homes destroyed in the county for a total of $6.3 million.  Many beach homes were damaged, with 221 homes damaged at Sunset Beach alone. Crop damage in Brunswick county was also widespread, with 50 percent of the tobacco crop lost, and 30 percent of the corn and field vegetables destroyed.  New Hanover county was the next hardest hit, with many business damaged in Wilmington and surrounding cities.  The majority of the county had power outages from downed limbs on power lines.  Rainfall ranged from two inches near the coast, to around four inches from eastern Bladen county, south through Columbus county.  Vegetative debris was widespread, plugging storm drains and contributing to ponding and flooding the next day.  Storm surge was minimal, with some minor overwash.  Thankfully, only a few minor injuries were reported.","",361

A peak wind gust of 98 mph was measured at the Jennettes Pier WxFlow site at 12:23 PM EDT.","Hurricane Dorian was the fourth named storm, second hurricane, and first major hurricane of the 2019 Atlantic hurricane season. Dorian formed on August 24, 2019 from a tropical wave in the Central Atlantic and gradually strengthened as it moved toward the Lesser Antilles, becoming a hurricane on August 28. Rapid intensification occurred, and on August 31, Dorian became a Category 4 hurricane. On September 1, Dorian reached Category 5 intensity, with maximum sustained winds of 185 mph, and a minimum central pressure of 910 mb  (26.87 inHg) while making landfall in Elbow Cay, Bahamas. Dorian made another landfall on Grand Bahama several hours later. The ridge of high pressure steering Dorian westward collapsed on September 2, causing Dorian to stall just north of Grand Bahama for about a day. It is the strongest known tropical system to impact the Bahamas. A combination of cold water upwelling and an eyewall replacement cycle weakened Dorian to a Category 2 hurricane on the next day. On the morning of September 3, Dorian began to move slowly towards the north-northwest. Dorian subsequently completed its eyewall replacement cycle and moved over warmer waters, regaining Category 3 intensity by midnight on September 5. In the early hours of September 6, Dorian weakened to Category 1 intensity as it picked up speed and turned northeast. Dorian would pick up speed and move northeast along the North Carolina coast September 6, moving east of the Crystal Coast, clipping Cape Lookout and eventually making landfall at Cape Hatteras before making yet another landfall in Nova Scotia on September 8.||The initial impacts from Dorian actually occurred during the morning hours of September 5 when several tornadoes touched down in eastern North Carolina.
