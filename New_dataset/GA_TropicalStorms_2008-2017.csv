The storm moved west along the south coast of Cuba before reaching a weakness in the subtropical ridge to its north causing it turn north-northwestward into central Cuba by the 17th.  Fay continued to track north-northwest through the Florida straits and Florida Keys on the 18th before turning northeast toward the Florida peninsula.  The storm made landfall on August 19th in southwest Florida at Cape Romano as a tropical storm with winds of 60 mph.  Fay continued to move very slowly northeast across the central Florida peninsula, well maintaining its strength along the way, reaching the northeast coast of Florida on August 21st.  At this point, a strengthening subtropical ridge and surface high over the mid-Atlantic region forced Fay to take a sharp westward turn toward the Florida panhandle.  The storm tracked west to west-northwest from the 22nd through the 25th into extreme southeast Louisiana before reaching the western end of the subtropical ridge and an approaching frontal system.  Thus, Fay once again turned back toward the northeast across central Mississippi and central/northern Alabama before finally becoming absorbed into the mean flow and a frontal system located across the Tennessee Valley.||The slow movement of Fay and the proximity to the forecast area allowed for Fay's impacts on the Peachtree City forecast area to last several days.  Outer rain bands affected the southern parts of the forecast area as early as the 20th.  Outer rain bands continued to affect the southern counties as Fay tracked slowly west through the Florida Panhandle the 21st, 22nd, and 23rd.  Some of these produced gusty winds and a few trees were blown down in the far southeastern counties, namely Toombs with three downed trees and Emanuel with two downed trees.  While no tornadoes occurred at this point, tornado warnings were issued for several counties in the south central and southeast part of the forecast area.  Widespread heavy rain also affected the southwest part of the forecast area on the 23rd as the system tracked west across the Florida Panhandle.  As Fay stalled across southeast Louisiana on the 24th and began its move back to the northeast on the 25th, outer rain bands and thunderstorms started to move back into the area from the southwest during the afternoon of the 24th.  Widespread heavy rain followed on the 25th and 26th, especially across the northwest half of the forecast area.  As the remnant center of circulation moved into northern Alabama on the 26th, spiral bands of rotating thunderstorms tracked across north and central Georgia.  Six confirmed tornado touchdowns were observed in north central and northeast Georgia as a result of Fay.  These were the first tropical storm-related tornadoes to affect the Peachtree City forecast area since Hurricane Katrina on August 29, 2008.  No lives were lost, but three injuries occurred when one of the associated tornadoes destroyed mobile homes in Jackson county.  Two schools and dozens of homes were damaged in Hall county from other Fay associated tornadoes.  Estimated combined damages for the five days that tropical storm Fay affected the north and central Georgia area were $1.89 million.",6

The storm moved west along the south coast of Cuba before reaching a weakness in the subtropical ridge to its north causing it turn north-northwestward into central Cuba by the 17th.  Fay continued to track north-northwest through the Florida straits and Florida Keys on the 18th before turning northeast toward the Florida peninsula.  The storm made landfall on August 19th in southwest Florida at Cape Romano as a tropical storm with winds of 60 mph.  Fay continued to move very slowly northeast across the central Florida peninsula, well maintaining its strength along the way, reaching the northeast coast of Florida on August 21st.  At this point, a strengthening subtropical ridge and surface high over the mid-Atlantic region forced Fay to take a sharp westward turn toward the Florida panhandle.  The storm tracked west to west-northwest from the 22nd through the 25th into extreme southeast Louisiana before reaching the western end of the subtropical ridge and an approaching frontal system.  Thus, Fay once again turned back toward the northeast across central Mississippi and central/northern Alabama before finally becoming absorbed into the mean flow and a frontal system located across the Tennessee Valley.||The slow movement of Fay and the proximity to the forecast area allowed for Fay's impacts on the Peachtree City forecast area to last several days.  Outer rain bands affected the southern parts of the forecast area as early as the 20th.  Outer rain bands continued to affect the southern counties as Fay tracked slowly west through the Florida Panhandle the 21st, 22nd, and 23rd.  Some of these produced gusty winds and a few trees were blown down in the far southeastern counties, namely Toombs with three downed trees and Emanuel with two downed trees.  While no tornadoes occurred at this point, tornado warnings were issued for several counties in the south central and southeast part of the forecast area.  Widespread heavy rain also affected the southwest part of the forecast area on the 23rd as the system tracked west across the Florida Panhandle.

Widespread heavy rain followed on the 25th and 26th, especially across the northwest half of the forecast area.

The storm moved west along the south coast of Cuba before reaching a weakness in the subtropical ridge to its north causing it turn north-northwestward into central Cuba by the 17th.  Fay continued to track north-northwest through the Florida straits and Florida Keys on the 18th before turning northeast toward the Florida peninsula.  The storm made landfall on August 19th in southwest Florida at Cape Romano as a tropical storm with winds of 60 mph.  Fay continued to move very slowly northeast across the central Florida peninsula, well maintaining its strength along the way, reaching the northeast coast of Florida on August 21st.  At this point, a strengthening subtropical ridge and surface high over the mid-Atlantic region forced Fay to take a sharp westward turn toward the Florida panhandle.  The storm tracked west to west-northwest from the 22nd through the 25th into extreme southeast Louisiana before reaching the western end of the subtropical ridge and an approaching frontal system.  Thus, Fay once again turned back toward the northeast across central Mississippi and central/northern Alabama before finally becoming absorbed into the mean flow and a frontal system located across the Tennessee Valley.||The slow movement of Fay and the proximity to the forecast area allowed for Fay's impacts on the Peachtree City forecast area to last several days.  Outer rain bands affected the southern parts of the forecast area as early as the 20th.  Outer rain bands continued to affect the southern counties as Fay tracked slowly west through the Florida Panhandle the 21st, 22nd, and 23rd.  Some of these produced gusty winds and a few trees were blown down in the far southeastern counties, namely Toombs with three downed trees and Emanuel with two downed trees.  While no tornadoes occurred at this point, tornado warnings were issued for several counties in the south central and southeast part of the forecast area.  Widespread heavy rain also affected the southwest part of the forecast area on the 23rd as the system tracked west across the Florida Panhandle.

The storm made landfall on August 19th in southwest Florida at Cape Romano as a tropical storm with winds of 60 mph.  Fay continued to move very slowly northeast across the central Florida peninsula, well maintaining its strength along the way, reaching the northeast coast of Florida on August 21st.  At this point, a strengthening subtropical ridge and surface high over the mid-Atlantic region forced Fay to take a sharp westward turn toward the Florida panhandle.  The storm tracked west to west-northwest from the 22nd through the 25th into extreme southeast Louisiana before reaching the western end of the subtropical ridge and an approaching frontal system.  Thus, Fay once again turned back toward the northeast across central Mississippi and central/northern Alabama before finally becoming absorbed into the mean flow and a frontal system located across the Tennessee Valley.||The slow movement of Fay and the proximity to the forecast area allowed for Fay's impacts on the Peachtree City forecast area to last several days.

The remnants of the hurricane combined with a cold air wedge across north Georgia to bring abundant Atlantic and Gulf moisture into the region.  Twelve to 18-hour rainfall totals of 4-5 inches across north Georgia aggrevated totally saturated soils from an on of the wettest September and October periods on record to result in widespread creek, stream, and river flooding.  The generaly light to moderate intensity of the rainfall and its persistence over a long period of time resulted in limited flash flooding.  Damages from Hurricane Ida to Georgia were confined to minor flooding, mostly adjacent to rivers, creeks, and streams.  Some locations experienced flooding subsequently for several days.  Only 15 to 20 mph winds with some gusts to 25 mph were observed with the remnants of Ida as the tightly concentric wind field weakened rapidly with the inland movement.

Heavy rainfall, on the order of four to five inches, was common across north Georgia, with one to two inch amounts across central areas.  With the ground totally saturated from several prior months of heavy rainfall, widespread creek, stream, and river flooding was observed over a two to three day period.  Because the rain intensity was mostly moderate or less and extended over a period of 18-24 hours, flash flooding events were isolated, with most of the flood events being of the creek, stream, and river flood nature.||The small wind core of Hurricane Ida and its track across land significantly reduced the wind effects of this system on north and central Georgia.

Matthew then weakened slightly while turning north toward the Greater Antilles, remaining a Category 4 hurricane as it made landfall over Haiti���s Tiburon Peninsula early on October 4th. Matthew then continued north while maintaining a Category 4 strength before making a second landfall near the Guantanamo Province in Cuba later that day. Land interaction helped reduce the strength of Matthew to a Category 3 hurricane, before it re-intensified into a Category 4 hurricane while tracking northwest toward the Bahamas. Matthew then tracked about 25 miles west of Nassau before making  landfall for a 3rd time over Grand Bahama about 15 miles west-northwest of Freeport as a Category 4 hurricane on October 6th. Matthew then continued on a north-northwest track toward Florida before paralleling much of the Southeast coast in a slowly weakening state over the next couple days. Matthew tracked parallel to the northern half of the Southeast Georgia coast as a Category 2 hurricane (110 mph), before continuing to weaken to a Category 1 hurricane (85 mph) while passing much of the lower Southeast South Carolina coast. Minimum surface pressures of 983.1 mb at Savannah International Airport (KSAV), 980.6 mb at Beaufort Airport (KNBC) and 981.7 mb at Charleston International Airport (KCHS) where recorded as Matthew passed just offshore. Matthew then made its 4th and final landfall as a weak Category 1 hurricane (75 mph) near McClellanville, SC at approximately 1045 AM on October 8th. Matthew then re-emerged into the western Atlantic shortly after, briefly maintaining hurricane strength before transitioning into an extratropical cyclone on October 9th as it pulled away from Cape Hatteras, North Carolina. ||Across southeast Georgia and southeast South Carolina, the main impacts from Matthew included heavy rain, wind damage in the form of scattered to widespread trees and power lines blown down and storm surge, specifically along coastal locations from Tybee Island, GA north to Edisto Beach, SC. Storm total rainfall amounts generally ranged from 4.5 to 7 inches across western areas of Southeast Georgia and extreme western locations of Southeast South Carolina to 8 to 17 inches closer to the coast, highest in coastal counties of Southeast Georgia and the lower Southeast South Carolina coast. A peak storm total rainfall of 17.49 inches was recorded at Hunter Army Airfield in Georgia while a peak storm total rainfall of 16.90 inches was recorded near Edisto Island, SC.

Heavy rains also led to several instances of flash flooding with damage to roads and homes and helped produce long duration flooding along the Edisto River, Ashley River and Santee River. Wind damage produced numerous to widespread power outages and damage to homes and other structures throughout the area, most significantly at locations near the coast where 60 mph to 100 mph wind gusts occurred with rainbands surrounding the passing eye wall. On October 8th, a maximum sustained wind of 75 mph and peak wind gust of 96 mph was recorded at the Tybee Island South sensor (XTYE) in Georgia while a maximum sustained wind of 67 mph was recorded at the Beaufort (XBUF) sensor in South Carolina and peak wind gust of 87 mph was recorded at the Hilton Head Airport (KHXD) sensor in South Carolina.

On October 8th, a maximum sustained wind of 75 mph and peak wind gust of 96 mph was recorded at the Tybee Island South sensor (XTYE) in Georgia while a maximum sustained wind of 67 mph was recorded at the Beaufort (XBUF) sensor in South Carolina and peak wind gust of 87 mph was recorded at the Hilton Head Airport (KHXD) sensor in South Carolina. Three deaths and 1 injury occurred from trees falling on homes or cars in Southeast Georgia.  The most extensive damage came with storm surge during Matthew. The entire Southeast Georgia and Southeast South Carolina coast was impacted by storm surge generally ranging between 2 to 5 ft with some locations as high as 6 to 8 ft. A peak surge of 7.69 ft occurred at the Fort Pulaski tide gauge at 248 AM October 8th while a peak surge of 6.20 ft occurred at the Charleston Harbor tide gauge at 5 AM October 8th. Damage from surge was most notable on the northern ends of Tybee Island in Georgia, Fripp Island in South Carolina and Edisto Island in South Carolina. Locations on Fripp Island and Edisto Island saw some of the most significant beach erosion and damage to oceanfront homes in the entire area.",455

In addition, 5 traffic signals were either loose or fell to the ground. Railroad crossing gates were also damaged.","Matthew first developed into a Tropical Storm about 35 miles southeast of St. Lucia on September 28 before quickly strengthening into a powerful hurricane as it tracked westward across the Caribbean Sea. Matthew then became a hurricane about 190 miles northeast of Curacao on September 29th before reaching Category 5 strength the following day. Matthew then weakened slightly while turning north toward the Greater Antilles, remaining a Category 4 hurricane as it made landfall over Haiti���s Tiburon Peninsula early on October 4th. Matthew then continued north while maintaining a Category 4 strength before making a second landfall near the Guantanamo Province in Cuba later that day. Land interaction helped reduce the strength of Matthew to a Category 3 hurricane, before it re-intensified into a Category 4 hurricane while tracking northwest toward the Bahamas. Matthew then tracked about 25 miles west of Nassau before making  landfall for a 3rd time over Grand Bahama about 15 miles west-northwest of Freeport as a Category 4 hurricane on October 6th. Matthew then continued on a north-northwest track toward Florida before paralleling much of the Southeast coast in a slowly weakening state over the next couple days. Matthew tracked parallel to the northern half of the Southeast Georgia coast as a Category 2 hurricane (110 mph), before continuing to weaken to a Category 1 hurricane (85 mph) while passing much of the lower Southeast South Carolina coast. Minimum surface pressures of 983.1 mb at Savannah International Airport (KSAV), 980.6 mb at Beaufort Airport (KNBC) and 981.7 mb at Charleston International Airport (KCHS) where recorded as Matthew passed just offshore. Matthew then made its 4th and final landfall as a weak Category 1 hurricane (75 mph) near McClellanville, SC at approximately 1045 AM on October 8th. Matthew then re-emerged into the western Atlantic shortly after, briefly maintaining hurricane strength before transitioning into an extratropical cyclone on October 9th as it pulled away from Cape Hatteras, North Carolina. ||Across southeast Georgia and southeast South Carolina, the main impacts from Matthew included heavy rain, wind damage in the form of scattered to widespread trees and power lines blown down and storm surge, specifically along coastal locations from Tybee Island, GA north to Edisto Beach, SC. Storm total rainfall amounts generally ranged from 4.5 to 7 inches across western areas of Southeast Georgia and extreme western locations of Southeast South Carolina to 8 to 17 inches closer to the coast, highest in coastal counties of Southeast Georgia and the lower Southeast South Carolina coast. A peak storm total rainfall of 17.49 inches was recorded at Hunter Army Airfield in Georgia while a peak storm total rainfall of 16.90 inches was recorded near Edisto Island, SC. Daily record rainfall totals were also set on October 7th and October 8th at the Savannah International Airport (KSAV), 4.36 inches and 3.84 inches, at the Charleston International Airport (KCHS), 4.7 inches and 5.77 inches and in downtown Charleston (KCXM), 4.36 inches and 3.84 inches respectively.
