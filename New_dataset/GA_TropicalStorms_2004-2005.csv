Hurricane "Frances" made landfall along the central Florida coast and, as a weakening system, moved west-northwest across central Florida and then northwestwards into southwest Georgia.  This motion brought the area into the periphery of the storm and southeast Georgia experienced sustained tropical storm force winds with higher gusts.  Across portions of southeast Georgia heavy rainfall resulted in extensive flooding in many locations.  

The lowest Mean Sea Level Pressure readings across southeast Georgia ranged from 995.2 mb/29.39 in Hg at  Douglas Airport (KDQH) to 1002.3 mb/29.60 in Hg at Brunswick, Glynnco Airport (KBQK). 

Maximum sustained winds recorded in southeast Georgia were 35 knots/40 mph at the Alma Airport.  The peak recorded gusts were 39 knots/45 mph at both Alma and Waycross Airports.  Unofficial gusts of 55 to 60 mph occurred along the immediate coast at St. Simons Island. Some tree blow down occurred in bands with roof and some structural damage.  Most structural damage was associated with mobile homes and generally weakly constructed permanent structures. Several cases of large trees destroying manufactured homes were reported, with two injured occurring in Wayne County due to trees down on homes.

Wave heights of 10 to 20 feet were recorded across the coastal waters with tides running one to two feet above astronomical tide levels.  The right lane of the St. Simons Island Causeway was flooded and impassable. Extensive beach erosion occurred due to long duration of onshore winds both from "Frances" as well as a period of onshore flow preceding the event.

Rainfall totals across southeast Georgia generally ranged from 5 to 10 inches.  The heaviest rainfall was associated with a rainband which moved out of Apalachee Bay across north Florida, the Suwannee Valley and into portions of Southeast Georgia. This band dropped up to 16 inches of rain from near Ocala, Florida through the Suwannee Valley and then across the Florida-Georgia State line over Waycross to near Baxley.  Peak Cooperative Observer rainfall reports with this band are 11.94 inches at Patterson and 10.40 inches at Baxley.  Homes were flooded across the region with the St. Marys River area in Camden and Clinch Counties especially hard hit.  Many primary roads were flooded and secondary and dirt roads were washed out for up to a week.  Most rivers in the region were pushed to flood stage with several approaching record flood. 

Tornadoes occurred across the entire region with over 20 confirmed touchdowns.  The banded nature of the tropical storm wind damage made it very difficult to differentiate between wind damage and tornado damage in subsequent storm damage surveys. No fatalities or injuries are believed to have occurred due to tornado touchdowns.

Overall tree blow down, power outages and roadways blocked by trees were reported most areas. In the heavy rainfall areas many dirt and secondary roads were left impassable for an extended period.","",9

Continuing north-northwestward from this point, Tropical Storm Frances entered far southwest Georgia near Bainbridge late in the evening on the 6th.  The storm continued moving north-northwest through far western Georgia on the 7th to near Atlanta around midnight on the 7th, then to near Chattanooga, Tennessee early on the 8th.  By far the most significant problem with Frances for Georgia was strong, sustained winds of 35 to 40 mph with gusts in excess of 50 mph.  Most of the high winds were concentrated in a large east-west oriented rain band that moved north across Georgia during the evening of the 6th and the early morning hours of the 7th.

The strongest winds and most significant damage occurred in the areas east and south of a line from Americus, to Atlanta, to Athens.   Many of the counties within this area suffered extensive wind damage.  Dozens to hundreds of trees were blown down, also bringing down dozens to hundreds of power lines.  Nearly 300,000 people were left without power during the storm, several thousand for several days.  Dozens of homes suffered major damage throughout Central and North Central Georgia, with dozens more sustaining minor damage.  The most significant damage took place in an area bounded by Macon, Atlanta, Greensboro, Dublin, Americus, and back to Macon.  Damages in the millions were observed in several of these counties, including several large pecan orchards which were virtually destroyed.  Estimated total damage with Frances $14.9 million to property and $26.5 million to crops (mostly pecan, but some peanut and cotton).

The most significant damage took place in an area bounded by Macon, Atlanta, Greensboro, Dublin, Americus, and back to Macon.  Damages in the millions were observed in several of these counties, including several large pecan orchards which were virtually destroyed.  Estimated total damage with Frances $14.9 million to property and $26.5 million to crops (mostly pecan, but some peanut and cotton).  Forty-one counties in the Peachtree City forecast area received a disaster declaration from the Federal Emergency Management Agency.",135

The system became a tropical depression on September 2nd, and tropical storm on September 3rd, and a hurricane early on September 5th.  Later that same day, it became a major hurricane.  Ivan moved westward for several days and passed over the southern Windward islands, then moved west-northwest through the southern Caribbean passing just north of Venezuela and the Netherlands Antilles.  The hurricane reached category five strength on September 9th as it neared Jamaica.  The hurricane weakened to a category four storm as it passed near Jamaica.  The storm maintained its category four strength as it turned slightly west of north until the 11th when it briefly strengthed once again to a category five storm.  The storm passed near Grand Cayman and the west tip of Cuba from September 11th to the 12th as mostly a category four hurricane.  The storm then turned to the northwest and moved through the Yucatan Channel. It briefly regained category five strength one more time as it moved through the Gulf, but weakened to a category three hurricane by the time it struck the U.S. Gulf Coast near Gulf Shores, Alabama around 2 am September 16th.  From here, the weakening hurricane moved nearly due north to near Birmingham by the evening of the 16th.  By this time it had weakened to a tropical storm.  The storm then turned northeast across northwest Georgia during the early morning hours of the 17th as it weakened to a tropical depression.  Ivan brought tornadoes, high winds, and significant to record flooding to north and central Georgia.  The track of Ivan across central and northeast Alabama also put much of central and eastern Georgia in the favorable quadrant for strong spiral feeder bands and tornadoes.  Six tornadoes were confirmed with Ivan causing an estimated $3.4 million dollars in damages.  These tornadoes consisted of two F1 tornadoes, one each in Madison and Wilkes county in northeast Georgia, with one F0 tornado reported in Cherokee, Madison, Spalding, and Upson counties.  Numerous reports of funnel clouds and other tornado sightings were reported, but no other tornado touchdowns were confirmed.  Flooding was extensive and widespread across the west central, north central, and northwest parts of the state.  Average rainfall of 5-8 inches was reported in much of the area northwest of a Columbus, to Athens line, with some areas from Atlanta northwest to Trenton reporting in excess of 10 inches of rain.  This rain fell just a little over a week from the 3-5 inches of rain which occurred from Tropical Storm Frances.  Catastrophic and historical flooding occurred in the Atlanta area, where the excessive rainfall forced many creeks and rivers to record levels.  Dozens of homes and businesses in Fulton, Cobb, DeKalb, and Cherokee counties were submerged in flood waters, some for several days thereafter.  Extensive flooding was also reported further north and west, especially in Dade and Gilmer counties, where homes and vehicles were washed away by flood waters.  Damage estimates from flooding in the Peachtree City forecast area were $40.9 million dollars.  Overall, sustained high winds with Ivan affected less of north and central Georgia than was observed with Frances, just 10 days prior.  However, with Ivan the problem was more with wind gusts than it was with sustained winds, such as were observed with Frances.  Wind gusts of 50-60 mph were common with one main southeast-northwest oriented spiral rain band that swept across the area during the mid and late afternoon.  This left many counties in north and central Georgia with downed trees, power lines, damages to homes, businesses, and vehicles, as well as widespread power outages.  Strong winds continued well into the 18th across the north causing even more trees and some power lines to fall.  Damages estimates from high winds were $14.3 million dollars.  Another $5.0 million in damages was caused by river flooding in Cobb county which continued for several days after Ivan exited the area.  Twenty-three counties in the Peachtree City, Georgia forecast area of north and central Georgia were given a disaster declaration by the Federal Emergency Management Agency.",154

The storm maintained its category four strength as it turned slightly west of north until the 11th when it briefly strengthed once again to a category five storm.  The storm passed near Grand Cayman and the west tip of Cuba from September 11th to the 12th as mostly a category four hurricane.  The storm then turned to the northwest and moved through the Yucatan Channel. It briefly regained category five strength one more time as it moved through the Gulf, but weakened to a category three hurricane by the time it struck the U.S. Gulf Coast near Gulf Shores, Alabama around 2 am September 16th.  From here, the weakening hurricane moved nearly due north to near Birmingham by the evening of the 16th.  By this time it had weakened to a tropical storm.  The storm then turned northeast across northwest Georgia during the early morning hours of the 17th as it weakened to a tropical depression.  Ivan brought tornadoes, high winds, and significant to record flooding to north and central Georgia.  The track of Ivan across central and northeast Alabama also put much of central and eastern Georgia in the favorable quadrant for strong spiral feeder bands and tornadoes.  Six tornadoes were confirmed with Ivan causing an estimated $3.4 million dollars in damages.  These tornadoes consisted of two F1 tornadoes, one each in Madison and Wilkes county in northeast Georgia, with one F0 tornado reported in Cherokee, Madison, Spalding, and Upson counties.  Numerous reports of funnel clouds and other tornado sightings were reported, but no other tornado touchdowns were confirmed.  Flooding was extensive and widespread across the west central, north central, and northwest parts of the state.  Average rainfall of 5-8 inches was reported in much of the area northwest of a Columbus, to Athens line, with some areas from Atlanta northwest to Trenton reporting in excess of 10 inches of rain.  This rain fell just a little over a week from the 3-5 inches of rain which occurred from Tropical Storm Frances.  Catastrophic and historical flooding occurred in the Atlanta area, where the excessive rainfall forced many creeks and rivers to record levels.  Dozens of homes and businesses in Fulton, Cobb, DeKalb, and Cherokee counties were submerged in flood waters, some for several days thereafter.  Extensive flooding was also reported further north and west, especially in Dade and Gilmer counties, where homes and vehicles were washed away by flood waters.  Damage estimates from flooding in the Peachtree City forecast area were $40.9 million dollars.  Overall, sustained high winds with Ivan affected less of north and central Georgia than was observed with Frances, just 10 days prior.  However, with Ivan the problem was more with wind gusts than it was with sustained winds, such as were observed with Frances.  Wind gusts of 50-60 mph were common with one main southeast-northwest oriented spiral rain band that swept across the area during the mid and late afternoon.  This left many counties in north and central Georgia with downed trees, power lines, damages to homes, businesses, and vehicles, as well as widespread power outages.  Strong winds continued well into the 18th across the north causing even more trees and some power lines to fall.  Damages estimates from high winds were $14.3 million dollars.

The system became a tropical depression on September 2nd, and tropical storm on September 3rd, and a hurricane early on September 5th.  Later that same day, it became a major hurricane.  Ivan moved westward for several days and passed over the southern Windward islands, then moved west-northwest through the southern Caribbean passing just north of Venezuela and the Netherlands Antilles.

The storm maintained its category four strength as it turned slightly west of north until the 11th when it briefly strengthed once again to a category five storm.  The storm passed near Grand Cayman and the west tip of Cuba from September 11th to the 12th as mostly a category four hurricane.  The storm then turned to the northwest and moved through the Yucatan Channel. It briefly regained category five strength one more time as it moved through the Gulf, but weakened to a category three hurricane by the time it struck the U.S. Gulf Coast near Gulf Shores, Alabama around 2 am September 16th.  From here, the weakening hurricane moved nearly due north to near Birmingham by the evening of the 16th.  By this time it had weakened to a tropical storm.

The track of Ivan across central and northeast Alabama also put much of central and eastern Georgia in the favorable quadrant for strong spiral feeder bands and tornadoes.  Six tornadoes were confirmed with Ivan causing an estimated $3.4 million dollars in damages.  These tornadoes consisted of two F1 tornadoes, one each in Madison and Wilkes county in northeast Georgia, with one F0 tornado reported in Cherokee, Madison, Spalding, and Upson counties.  Numerous reports of funnel clouds and other tornado sightings were reported, but no other tornado touchdowns were confirmed.  Flooding was extensive and widespread across the west central, north central, and northwest parts of the state.  Average rainfall of 5-8 inches was reported in much of the area northwest of a Columbus, to Athens line, with some areas from Atlanta northwest to Trenton reporting in excess of 10 inches of rain.  This rain fell just a little over a week from the 3-5 inches of rain which occurred from Tropical Storm Frances.  Catastrophic and historical flooding occurred in the Atlanta area, where the excessive rainfall forced many creeks and rivers to record levels.

Numerous reports of funnel clouds and other tornado sightings were reported, but no other tornado touchdowns were confirmed.  Flooding was extensive and widespread across the west central, north central, and northwest parts of the state.  Average rainfall of 5-8 inches was reported in much of the area northwest of a Columbus, to Athens line, with some areas from Atlanta northwest to Trenton reporting in excess of 10 inches of rain.  This rain fell just a little over a week from the 3-5 inches of rain which occurred from Tropical Storm Frances.  Catastrophic and historical flooding occurred in the Atlanta area, where the excessive rainfall forced many creeks and rivers to record levels.  Dozens of homes and businesses in Fulton, Cobb, DeKalb, and Cherokee counties were submerged in flood waters, some for several days thereafter.  Extensive flooding was also reported further north and west, especially in Dade and Gilmer counties, where homes and vehicles were washed away by flood waters.  Damage estimates from flooding in the Peachtree City forecast area were $40.9 million dollars.  Overall, sustained high winds with Ivan affected less of north and central Georgia than was observed with Frances, just 10 days prior.  However, with Ivan the problem was more with wind gusts than it was with sustained winds, such as were observed with Frances.  Wind gusts of 50-60 mph were common with one main southeast-northwest oriented spiral rain band that swept across the area during the mid and late afternoon.  This left many counties in north and central Georgia with downed trees, power lines, damages to homes, businesses, and vehicles, as well as widespread power outages.  Strong winds continued well into the 18th across the north causing even more trees and some power lines to fall.  Damages estimates from high winds were $14.3 million dollars.

The hurricane reached category five strength on September 9th as it neared Jamaica.  The hurricane weakened to a category four storm as it passed near Jamaica.  The storm maintained its category four strength as it turned slightly west of north until the 11th when it briefly strengthed once again to a category five storm.  The storm passed near Grand Cayman and the west tip of Cuba from September 11th to the 12th as mostly a category four hurricane.  The storm then turned to the northwest and moved through the Yucatan Channel. It briefly regained category five strength one more time as it moved through the Gulf, but weakened to a category three hurricane by the time it struck the U.S. Gulf Coast near Gulf Shores, Alabama around 2 am September 16th.  From here, the weakening hurricane moved nearly due north to near Birmingham by the evening of the 16th.  By this time it had weakened to a tropical storm.  The storm then turned northeast across northwest Georgia during the early morning hours of the 17th as it weakened to a tropical depression.  Ivan brought tornadoes, high winds, and significant to record flooding to north and central Georgia.  The track of Ivan across central and northeast Alabama also put much of central and eastern Georgia in the favorable quadrant for strong spiral feeder bands and tornadoes.  Six tornadoes were confirmed with Ivan causing an estimated $3.4 million dollars in damages.  These tornadoes consisted of two F1 tornadoes, one each in Madison and Wilkes county in northeast Georgia, with one F0 tornado reported in Cherokee, Madison, Spalding, and Upson counties.  Numerous reports of funnel clouds and other tornado sightings were reported, but no other tornado touchdowns were confirmed.  Flooding was extensive and widespread across the west central, north central, and northwest parts of the state.  Average rainfall of 5-8 inches was reported in much of the area northwest of a Columbus, to Athens line, with some areas from Atlanta northwest to Trenton reporting in excess of 10 inches of rain.  This rain fell just a little over a week from the 3-5 inches of rain which occurred from Tropical Storm Frances.  Catastrophic and historical flooding occurred in the Atlanta area, where the excessive rainfall forced many creeks and rivers to record levels.  Dozens of homes and businesses in Fulton, Cobb, DeKalb, and Cherokee counties were submerged in flood waters, some for several days thereafter.  Extensive flooding was also reported further north and west, especially in Dade and Gilmer counties, where homes and vehicles were washed away by flood waters.  Damage estimates from flooding in the Peachtree City forecast area were $40.9 million dollars.  Overall, sustained high winds with Ivan affected less of north and central Georgia than was observed with Frances, just 10 days prior.  However, with Ivan the problem was more with wind gusts than it was with sustained winds, such as were observed with Frances.  Wind gusts of 50-60 mph were common with one main southeast-northwest oriented spiral rain band that swept across the area during the mid and late afternoon.  This left many counties in north and central Georgia with downed trees, power lines, damages to homes, businesses, and vehicles, as well as widespread power outages.  Strong winds continued well into the 18th across the north causing even more trees and some power lines to fall.  Damages estimates from high winds were $14.3 million dollars.

Six tornadoes were confirmed with Ivan causing an estimated $3.4 million dollars in damages.  These tornadoes consisted of two F1 tornadoes, one each in Madison and Wilkes county in northeast Georgia, with one F0 tornado reported in Cherokee, Madison, Spalding, and Upson counties.  Numerous reports of funnel clouds and other tornado sightings were reported, but no other tornado touchdowns were confirmed.  Flooding was extensive and widespread across the west central, north central, and northwest parts of the state.  Average rainfall of 5-8 inches was reported in much of the area northwest of a Columbus, to Athens line, with some areas from Atlanta northwest to Trenton reporting in excess of 10 inches of rain.  This rain fell just a little over a week from the 3-5 inches of rain which occurred from Tropical Storm Frances.  Catastrophic and historical flooding occurred in the Atlanta area, where the excessive rainfall forced many creeks and rivers to record levels.  Dozens of homes and businesses in Fulton, Cobb, DeKalb, and Cherokee counties were submerged in flood waters, some for several days thereafter.  Extensive flooding was also reported further north and west, especially in Dade and Gilmer counties, where homes and vehicles were washed away by flood waters.  Damage estimates from flooding in the Peachtree City forecast area were $40.9 million dollars.  Overall, sustained high winds with Ivan affected less of north and central Georgia than was observed with Frances, just 10 days prior.  However, with Ivan the problem was more with wind gusts than it was with sustained winds, such as were observed with Frances.  Wind gusts of 50-60 mph were common with one main southeast-northwest oriented spiral rain band that swept across the area during the mid and late afternoon.  This left many counties in north and central Georgia with downed trees, power lines, damages to homes, businesses, and vehicles, as well as widespread power outages.  Strong winds continued well into the 18th across the north causing even more trees and some power lines to fall.  Damages estimates from high winds were $14.3 million dollars.

The system became a tropical depression on September 2nd, and tropical storm on September 3rd, and a hurricane early on September 5th.  Later that same day, it became a major hurricane.  Ivan moved westward for several days and passed over the southern Windward islands, then moved west-northwest through the southern Caribbean passing just north of Venezuela and the Netherlands Antilles.  The hurricane reached category five strength on September 9th as it neared Jamaica.  The hurricane weakened to a category four storm as it passed near Jamaica.  The storm maintained its category four strength as it turned slightly west of north until the 11th when it briefly strengthed once again to a category five storm.  The storm passed near Grand Cayman and the west tip of Cuba from September 11th to the 12th as mostly a category four hurricane.  The storm then turned to the northwest and moved through the Yucatan Channel. It briefly regained category five strength one more time as it moved through the Gulf, but weakened to a category three hurricane by the time it struck the U.S. Gulf Coast near Gulf Shores, Alabama around 2 am September 16th.  From here, the weakening hurricane moved nearly due north to near Birmingham by the evening of the 16th.  By this time it had weakened to a tropical storm.  The storm then turned northeast across northwest Georgia during the early morning hours of the 17th as it weakened to a tropical depression.  Ivan brought tornadoes, high winds, and significant to record flooding to north and central Georgia.  The track of Ivan across central and northeast Alabama also put much of central and eastern Georgia in the favorable quadrant for strong spiral feeder bands and tornadoes.  Six tornadoes were confirmed with Ivan causing an estimated $3.4 million dollars in damages.  These tornadoes consisted of two F1 tornadoes, one each in Madison and Wilkes county in northeast Georgia, with one F0 tornado reported in Cherokee, Madison, Spalding, and Upson counties.  Numerous reports of funnel clouds and other tornado sightings were reported, but no other tornado touchdowns were confirmed.  Flooding was extensive and widespread across the west central, north central, and northwest parts of the state.  Average rainfall of 5-8 inches was reported in much of the area northwest of a Columbus, to Athens line, with some areas from Atlanta northwest to Trenton reporting in excess of 10 inches of rain.  This rain fell just a little over a week from the 3-5 inches of rain which occurred from Tropical Storm Frances.  Catastrophic and historical flooding occurred in the Atlanta area, where the excessive rainfall forced many creeks and rivers to record levels.  Dozens of homes and businesses in Fulton, Cobb, DeKalb, and Cherokee counties were submerged in flood waters, some for several days thereafter.  Extensive flooding was also reported further north and west, especially in Dade and Gilmer counties, where homes and vehicles were washed away by flood waters.  Damage estimates from flooding in the Peachtree City forecast area were $40.9 million dollars.  Overall, sustained high winds with Ivan affected less of north and central Georgia than was observed with Frances, just 10 days prior.  However, with Ivan the problem was more with wind gusts than it was with sustained winds, such as were observed with Frances.  Wind gusts of 50-60 mph were common with one main southeast-northwest oriented spiral rain band that swept across the area during the mid and late afternoon.  This left many counties in north and central Georgia with downed trees, power lines, damages to homes, businesses, and vehicles, as well as widespread power outages.  Strong winds continued well into the 18th across the north causing even more trees and some power lines to fall.  Damages estimates from high winds were $14.3 million dollars.

The storm then turned to the northwest and moved through the Yucatan Channel. It briefly regained category five strength one more time as it moved through the Gulf, but weakened to a category three hurricane by the time it struck the U.S. Gulf Coast near Gulf Shores, Alabama around 2 am September 16th.  From here, the weakening hurricane moved nearly due north to near Birmingham by the evening of the 16th.  By this time it had weakened to a tropical storm.  The storm then turned northeast across northwest Georgia during the early morning hours of the 17th as it weakened to a tropical depression.  Ivan brought tornadoes, high winds, and significant to record flooding to north and central Georgia.  The track of Ivan across central and northeast Alabama also put much of central and eastern Georgia in the favorable quadrant for strong spiral feeder bands and tornadoes.  Six tornadoes were confirmed with Ivan causing an estimated $3.4 million dollars in damages.  These tornadoes consisted of two F1 tornadoes, one each in Madison and Wilkes county in northeast Georgia, with one F0 tornado reported in Cherokee, Madison, Spalding, and Upson counties.  Numerous reports of funnel clouds and other tornado sightings were reported, but no other tornado touchdowns were confirmed.  Flooding was extensive and widespread across the west central, north central, and northwest parts of the state.  Average rainfall of 5-8 inches was reported in much of the area northwest of a Columbus, to Athens line, with some areas from Atlanta northwest to Trenton reporting in excess of 10 inches of rain.  This rain fell just a little over a week from the 3-5 inches of rain which occurred from Tropical Storm Frances.  Catastrophic and historical flooding occurred in the Atlanta area, where the excessive rainfall forced many creeks and rivers to record levels.  Dozens of homes and businesses in Fulton, Cobb, DeKalb, and Cherokee counties were submerged in flood waters, some for several days thereafter.  Extensive flooding was also reported further north and west, especially in Dade and Gilmer counties, where homes and vehicles were washed away by flood waters.  Damage estimates from flooding in the Peachtree City forecast area were $40.9 million dollars.  Overall, sustained high winds with Ivan affected less of north and central Georgia than was observed with Frances, just 10 days prior.  However, with Ivan the problem was more with wind gusts than it was with sustained winds, such as were observed with Frances.  Wind gusts of 50-60 mph were common with one main southeast-northwest oriented spiral rain band that swept across the area during the mid and late afternoon.  This left many counties in north and central Georgia with downed trees, power lines, damages to homes, businesses, and vehicles, as well as widespread power outages.  Strong winds continued well into the 18th across the north causing even more trees and some power lines to fall.  Damages estimates from high winds were $14.3 million dollars.

The system became a tropical depression on September 2nd, and tropical storm on September 3rd, and a hurricane early on September 5th.  Later that same day, it became a major hurricane.  Ivan moved westward for several days and passed over the southern Windward islands, then moved west-northwest through the southern Caribbean passing just north of Venezuela and the Netherlands Antilles.  The hurricane reached category five strength on September 9th as it neared Jamaica.  The hurricane weakened to a category four storm as it passed near Jamaica.  The storm maintained its category four strength as it turned slightly west of north until the 11th when it briefly strengthed once again to a category five storm.  The storm passed near Grand Cayman and the west tip of Cuba from September 11th to the 12th as mostly a category four hurricane.  The storm then turned to the northwest and moved through the Yucatan Channel. It briefly regained category five strength one more time as it moved through the Gulf, but weakened to a category three hurricane by the time it struck the U.S. Gulf Coast near Gulf Shores, Alabama around 2 am September 16th.  From here, the weakening hurricane moved nearly due north to near Birmingham by the evening of the 16th.  By this time it had weakened to a tropical storm.  The storm then turned northeast across northwest Georgia during the early morning hours of the 17th as it weakened to a tropical depression.  Ivan brought tornadoes, high winds, and significant to record flooding to north and central Georgia.  The track of Ivan across central and northeast Alabama also put much of central and eastern Georgia in the favorable quadrant for strong spiral feeder bands and tornadoes.  Six tornadoes were confirmed with Ivan causing an estimated $3.4 million dollars in damages.  These tornadoes consisted of two F1 tornadoes, one each in Madison and Wilkes county in northeast Georgia, with one F0 tornado reported in Cherokee, Madison, Spalding, and Upson counties.  Numerous reports of funnel clouds and other tornado sightings were reported, but no other tornado touchdowns were confirmed.  Flooding was extensive and widespread across the west central, north central, and northwest parts of the state.  Average rainfall of 5-8 inches was reported in much of the area northwest of a Columbus, to Athens line, with some areas from Atlanta northwest to Trenton reporting in excess of 10 inches of rain.  This rain fell just a little over a week from the 3-5 inches of rain which occurred from Tropical Storm Frances.  Catastrophic and historical flooding occurred in the Atlanta area, where the excessive rainfall forced many creeks and rivers to record levels.  Dozens of homes and businesses in Fulton, Cobb, DeKalb, and Cherokee counties were submerged in flood waters, some for several days thereafter.  Extensive flooding was also reported further north and west, especially in Dade and Gilmer counties, where homes and vehicles were washed away by flood waters.  Damage estimates from flooding in the Peachtree City forecast area were $40.9 million dollars.  Overall, sustained high winds with Ivan affected less of north and central Georgia than was observed with Frances, just 10 days prior.  However, with Ivan the problem was more with wind gusts than it was with sustained winds, such as were observed with Frances.  Wind gusts of 50-60 mph were common with one main southeast-northwest oriented spiral rain band that swept across the area during the mid and late afternoon.

The storm maintained its category four strength as it turned slightly west of north until the 11th when it briefly strengthed once again to a category five storm.  The storm passed near Grand Cayman and the west tip of Cuba from September 11th to the 12th as mostly a category four hurricane.  The storm then turned to the northwest and moved through the Yucatan Channel. It briefly regained category five strength one more time as it moved through the Gulf, but weakened to a category three hurricane by the time it struck the U.S. Gulf Coast near Gulf Shores, Alabama around 2 am September 16th.  From here, the weakening hurricane moved nearly due north to near Birmingham by the evening of the 16th.  By this time it had weakened to a tropical storm.  The storm then turned northeast across northwest Georgia during the early morning hours of the 17th as it weakened to a tropical depression.  Ivan brought tornadoes, high winds, and significant to record flooding to north and central Georgia.  The track of Ivan across central and northeast Alabama also put much of central and eastern Georgia in the favorable quadrant for strong spiral feeder bands and tornadoes.  Six tornadoes were confirmed with Ivan causing an estimated $3.4 million dollars in damages.  These tornadoes consisted of two F1 tornadoes, one each in Madison and Wilkes county in northeast Georgia, with one F0 tornado reported in Cherokee, Madison, Spalding, and Upson counties.  Numerous reports of funnel clouds and other tornado sightings were reported, but no other tornado touchdowns were confirmed.  Flooding was extensive and widespread across the west central, north central, and northwest parts of the state.  Average rainfall of 5-8 inches was reported in much of the area northwest of a Columbus, to Athens line, with some areas from Atlanta northwest to Trenton reporting in excess of 10 inches of rain.  This rain fell just a little over a week from the 3-5 inches of rain which occurred from Tropical Storm Frances.  Catastrophic and historical flooding occurred in the Atlanta area, where the excessive rainfall forced many creeks and rivers to record levels.  Dozens of homes and businesses in Fulton, Cobb, DeKalb, and Cherokee counties were submerged in flood waters, some for several days thereafter.  Extensive flooding was also reported further north and west, especially in Dade and Gilmer counties, where homes and vehicles were washed away by flood waters.  Damage estimates from flooding in the Peachtree City forecast area were $40.9 million dollars.  Overall, sustained high winds with Ivan affected less of north and central Georgia than was observed with Frances, just 10 days prior.  However, with Ivan the problem was more with wind gusts than it was with sustained winds, such as were observed with Frances.  Wind gusts of 50-60 mph were common with one main southeast-northwest oriented spiral rain band that swept across the area during the mid and late afternoon.  This left many counties in north and central Georgia with downed trees, power lines, damages to homes, businesses, and vehicles, as well as widespread power outages.  Strong winds continued well into the 18th across the north causing even more trees and some power lines to fall.  Damages estimates from high winds were $14.3 million dollars.  Another $5.0 million in damages was caused by river flooding in Cobb county which continued for several days after Ivan exited the area.  Twenty-three counties in the Peachtree City, Georgia forecast area of north and central Georgia were given a disaster declaration by the Federal Emergency Management Agency.",247

Hurricane "Jeanne" made landfall along the central Florida east coast, very near the location of Hurricane "Frances" some two weeks earlier.  Like "Frances" this system moved west-northwest across central Florida and then northwestwards into southern Georgia.  This motion once again brought the area into the periphery of the storm as north Florida and southeast Georgia experienced sustained tropical storm force winds with gusts to near hurricane force along the coast.  Across the Suwannee Valley and portions of southeast Georgia sustained winds were higher than during "Frances" and rain once again resulted in flooding of many locations.  

The lowest local barometric pressure of 980.0 mb/28.94 in Hg was recorded in Ocala, Florida as the center moved to near the city.  The lowest pressure readings across north Florida ranged from 980.0/28.94 in HG at Ocala Airport (KOCF) to 999.4 mb/29.51 in Hg at the National Ocean Systems (NOS) Tide Gage in Fernandina Beach, Florida.  The lowest pressure readings across southeast Georgia ranged from 993.9 mb/29.35 in Hg at  Douglas airport (KDQH) to 1001.4 mb/29.57 in Hg at Brunswick, Glynnco Airport (KBQK). 

Maximum sustained winds recorded were 48 knots/55 mph at the St. Augustine CMAN site (SAUF1) on the St. Augustine Pier.  The peak gust was also recorded at SAUF1 with 65 knots/75 mph occurring on the 26th. Generally land stations (ASOS, AWOS III and mesonet stations) reported sustained winds of 30 to 50 mph with gusts of 40 to 60 mph.  Tree blow down once again occurred in bands with roof and some structural damage with the most pronounced damage over the Suwannee Valley and southeast Georgia where "Frances" was not quite as severe.  Most structural damage was associated with mobile homes and generally weakly constructed permanent structures. Several cases of large trees destroying manufactured homes were once again observed. One child was killed due to a tree fall.

Wave heights of 20 feet were recorded across the coastal waters with tides running one to two and a half feet above astronomical tide levels on the open ocean.  Tides three to four feet above astronomical occurred on the St. Johns River causing flooding in low lying areas.  Extensive beach erosion once again occurred due to long duration of onshore winds both from "Jeanne" as well as a period of onshore flow preceding the event.

Rainfall totals across north Florida and southeast Georgia generally ranged from 3 to 7 inches.  The heaviest rainfall was once again over the Suwannee Valley and southeast Georgia with Live Oak, Florida experiencing 10.88 inches of rain. Due to the already saturated conditions, sheet flooding, river flooding and road washouts again occurred with this event with Live Oak and southeast Georgia hard hit. Most rivers in the region returned to to flood stage and portions of Interstate 10 were again closed due to flooding.

Tornadoes occurred across the coastal region; however, the tornado outbreak was not as extensive as with "Frances."  The banded nature of the Tropical Storm wind damage again made it very difficult to differentiate between wind damage and tornado damage in subsequent storm damage surveys. No fatalities or injuries are believed to have occurred due to tornado touchdowns.

Overall tree blow down, power outages and roadways blocked by trees were reported in most areas. In the heavy rainfall areas many dirt and secondary roads were once again left impassable.","",262

Jeanne caused the least damage to north and central Georgia counties of the three tropical systems to affect the state during the month of September.  High winds were limited mainly to the southeast portions of middle Georgia and flooding rains were limited to the Atlanta area and south middle Georgia counties.  No tornadoes were observed with Jeanne as the favorable tornado-producing spiral feeder bands remained well east over the Carolinas and western Atlantic.  Hurricane Jeanne developed on September 13th from a tropical wave over the Leeward Islands.  Jeanne moved slowly across the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico on the 15th, then slowly over the Dominican Republic and Haiti the 16th and 17th.  Most of this time, the storm maintained only strong tropical storm strength.  Jeanne then took a northward turn on the 18th and moved across the southeastern Bahamas as a tropical storm.  From this point, Jeanne meandered through a slow clockwise loop from the 20th through 23rd, when the loop was finally completed.  During this time the storm strengthened to a category two hurricane.  Jeanne then began a slow westward track on the 23rd and strengthened to a category three hurricane.  The storm then made landfall on the 25th, just north of West Palm Beach, Florida, at almost the exact same location as Hurricane Frances had done 20 days prior.  Jeanne weakened to a tropical storm as it turned north-northwest across central Florida on the 26th and then weakened into a tropical depression as it moved into southern Georgia early on the 27th.  The storm tracked from near Valdosta during the early morning hours of the 27th, reaching Macon around sunset on the 27th, then accelerating into northeast Georgia near Athens by midnight and out of the state early on the 28th.  High winds of 35 to 40 mph with some higher gusts were confined mainly to the central and southeast portions of middle Georgia, roughly southeast of a line from Macon to Sandersville.  Rainfall of 4-6 inches was also common in much of middle Georgia, but flooding problems observed in these areas were minor.  However, during the evening, a deformation zone developed on the northwest side of the center of circulation around Jeanne over the Atlanta metropolitan area.  This unfortunately brought excessive rainfall of 4 to 8 inches to some of the same areas that received in excess of 10 inches of rain just 10 days prior with Ivan.  Once again major to record flooding was observed along several creeks on the north side of Atlanta and subsequently the Chattahoochee River.  Many homes that were in the stages of cleanup from Ivan, were severely impacted once again with major flooding.  Overall damages from flooding and high winds were estimated at $5,000,000.",267

From this point, Jeanne meandered through a slow clockwise loop from the 20th through 23rd, when the loop was finally completed.  During this time the storm strengthened to a category two hurricane.  Jeanne then began a slow westward track on the 23rd and strengthened to a category three hurricane.  The storm then made landfall on the 25th, just north of West Palm Beach, Florida, at almost the exact same location as Hurricane Frances had done 20 days prior.  Jeanne weakened to a tropical storm as it turned north-northwest across central Florida on the 26th and then weakened into a tropical depression as it moved into southern Georgia early on the 27th.  The storm tracked from near Valdosta during the early morning hours of the 27th, reaching Macon around sunset on the 27th, then accelerating into northeast Georgia near Athens by midnight and out of the state early on the 28th.  High winds of 35 to 40 mph with some higher gusts were confined mainly to the central and southeast portions of middle Georgia, roughly southeast of a line from Macon to Sandersville.  Rainfall of 4-6 inches was also common in much of middle Georgia, but flooding problems observed in these areas were minor.  However, during the evening, a deformation zone developed on the northwest side of the center of circulation around Jeanne over the Atlanta metropolitan area.  This unfortunately brought excessive rainfall of 4 to 8 inches to some of the same areas that received in excess of 10 inches of rain just 10 days prior with Ivan.  Once again major to record flooding was observed along several creeks on the north side of Atlanta and subsequently the Chattahoochee River.  Many homes that were in the stages of cleanup from Ivan, were severely impacted once again with major flooding.  Overall damages from flooding and high winds were estimated at $5,000,000.",363
