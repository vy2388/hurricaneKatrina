Sustained tropical storm force winds with gusts to near hurricane force occurred over the northwest quadrant of the storm over interior portions of northeast North Carolina and along the coastal waters of the Wakefield marine area. The center of the storm crossed the county warning area along an Elizabeth City to  Currituck county to Sandbridge Virginia Beach axis. The highest sustained wind speed recorded was 69 mph at Chesapeake Light (CHLV2). Other sustained wind speeds were 46 mph at Langley Air Force Base (LFI), 44 mph at Norfolk Naval Air Station (NGU), and 41 mph at Oceana Naval Air Station (NTU). The highest gusts recorded were 100 mph at the James River Bridge, 84 mph at Chesapeake Light, and 63 mph at Langley Air Force Base. Two confirmed tornadoes occurred in association with Floyd. There were approximately several thousand persons evacuated and housed in several shelters from coastal jurisdictions. Hundreds of trees and power lines were blown down across interior southeast Virginia and the immediate Hampton Roads area, resulting in widespread power outages. The tidal departure at Sewells Point in Norfolk was 3.9 feet above normal or 6.4 feet above MLLW. This resulted in moderate to locally severe coastal flooding approximately 2 hours before high tide on the 16th. The tide gage in downtown Norfolk recorded a tide of 7.1 feet above MLLW. Flooding was more widespread during Hurricane Floyd due to extremely heavy rainfall before and during the peak storm tide. Storm surge flooding of 5 to 7 feet occurred over central portions of the Chesapeake Bay inundating sections of Accomack county. Some homes were flooded with 3 to 6 feet of water. The lowest sea level pressure recorded was 970 mb at Chesapeake Light (CHLV2).

Floyd will be remembered as an extremely wet hurricane for east-central Virginia. The presence of a stalled frontal boundary provided the focus for extremely heavy rains. Rainfall amounts averaged 10 to 20 inches in a 50 to 75 mile swath centered over the headwaters of the Chowan River Basin in interior southeast Virginia and northeast North Carolina extending into the middle peninsula. Numerous roads were washed out due to flooding. Primary routes out of service included US 460 near Wakefield, US 58 near Emporia and Franklin, and Interstate 95 south of Petersburg to Emporia.",21

Sustained tropical storm force winds with frequent gusts to hurricane force occurred over Eastern Virginia, along and near the Chesapeake Bay and Atlantic Coastal Waters. Isabel made landfall near Ocracoke Inlet in North Carolina, tracked northwest into central Virginia just west of Richmond, then continued northward into western Pennsylvania. The highest sustained wind speed recorded was 72 mph at Chesapeake Light (CHLV2). Other sustained wind speeds were 69 mph at Gloucester Point (VIMS), 61 mph at the Chesapeake Bay Bridge Tunnel, 58 mph at Norfolk Naval Air Station (NGU), 57 mph at Sewells Point, and 55 mph at Oceana Naval Air Station (NTU). The highest gusts recorded were 107 mph at Gwynns Island (Mathews County), 100 mph at Reedville (Middlesex County), 93 mph at Chesapeake Light, 91 mph at Gloucester Point, and 83 mph at Norfolk Naval Air Station. Only one confirmed tornado occurred in association with Isabel. Mandatory evacuations were ordered for parts of Hampton Roads, with approximately several thousand persons evacuated and housed in numerous shelters across central and eastern Virginia. The unusually large wind field uprooted many thousands of trees, downed many power lines, damaged hundreds of houses, and snapped thousands of telephone poles and cross arms. Hundreds of roads, including major highways, were blocked by fallen trees. Over 2 million customers of Dominion Virginia Power were without electricity. Local electrical cooperatives also reported thousands of customers were without power. Storm surge varied significantly across the region. At Sewells Point, the maximum water level was 7.9 feet above MLLW. This represented a 5 foot storm surge. At Gloucester Point, the water level reached 8.32 feet, representing a 6.4 foot surge. A storm survey indicated a surge around 6.5 feet at Colonial Beach. On the Rappahannock, surge values between 5.5 and 6.0 feet occurred at Tappahannock and downstream near Dunnsville. Even higher surge values were noted up the rivers in eastern Virginia, such as the James, Potomac, York and Rappahannock. Storm surge values around 9 feet were estimated at West Point Virginia. At Richmond City Locks, a more than 8 foot surge was noted, and Smithfield also recorded an 8 foot storm surge. An estimated 8 foot surge also occurred near the intersection of the James and Appomattox Rivers in Hopewell. The lowest sea level pressure recorded was 987 mb at Portsmouth Virginia.

At Sewells Point, the maximum water level was 7.9 feet above MLLW. This represented a 5 foot storm surge. At Gloucester Point, the water level reached 8.32 feet, representing a 6.4 foot surge. A storm survey indicated a surge around 6.5 feet at Colonial Beach. On the Rappahannock, surge values between 5.5 and 6.0 feet occurred at Tappahannock and downstream near Dunnsville. Even higher surge values were noted up the rivers in eastern Virginia, such as the James, Potomac, York and Rappahannock. Storm surge values around 9 feet were estimated at West Point Virginia.

Sustained tropical storm force winds with frequent gusts to hurricane force occurred over Eastern Virginia, along and near the Chesapeake Bay and Atlantic Coastal Waters. Isabel made landfall near Ocracoke Inlet in North Carolina, tracked northwest into central Virginia just west of Richmond, then continued northward into western Pennsylvania. The highest sustained wind speed recorded was 72 mph at Chesapeake Light (CHLV2). Other sustained wind speeds were 69 mph at Gloucester Point (VIMS), 61 mph at the Chesapeake Bay Bridge Tunnel, 58 mph at Norfolk Naval Air Station (NGU), 57 mph at Sewells Point, and 55 mph at Oceana Naval Air Station (NTU). The highest gusts recorded were 107 mph at Gwynns Island (Mathews County), 100 mph at Reedville (Middlesex County), 93 mph at Chesapeake Light, 91 mph at Gloucester Point, and 83 mph at Norfolk Naval Air Station. Only one confirmed tornado occurred in association with Isabel. Mandatory evacuations were ordered for parts of Hampton Roads, with approximately several thousand persons evacuated and housed in numerous shelters across central and eastern Virginia. The unusually large wind field uprooted many thousands of trees, downed many power lines, damaged hundreds of houses, and snapped thousands of telephone poles and cross arms. Hundreds of roads, including major highways, were blocked by fallen trees. Over 2 million customers of Dominion Virginia Power were without electricity. Local electrical cooperatives also reported thousands of customers were without power. Storm surge varied significantly across the region. At Sewells Point, the maximum water level was 7.9 feet above MLLW. This represented a 5 foot storm surge. At Gloucester Point, the water level reached 8.32 feet, representing a 6.4 foot surge. A storm survey indicated a surge around 6.5 feet at Colonial Beach. On the Rappahannock, surge values between 5.5 and 6.0 feet occurred at Tappahannock and downstream near Dunnsville. Even higher surge values were noted up the rivers in eastern Virginia, such as the James, Potomac, York and Rappahannock. Storm surge values around 9 feet were estimated at West Point Virginia. At Richmond City Locks, a more than 8 foot surge was noted, and Smithfield also recorded an 8 foot storm surge. An estimated 8 foot surge also occurred near the intersection of the James and Appomattox Rivers in Hopewell. The lowest sea level pressure recorded was 987 mb at Portsmouth Virginia. Isabel will be remembered for the greatest wind and storm surge in the region since Hazel in 1954, and the 1933 Chesapeake-Potomac Hurricane. Also, Isabel will be remembered for the most extensive power outages ever in Virginia, and permanent change to the landscape from all the fallen trees and storm surge. Rainfall amounts ranged from 1.5 to 5 inches across eastern, and southeast Virginia. Toano in James City county reported 10.60 inches. Inland flooding due to heavy rainfall occurred over parts of eastern and southeast Virginia. Significant beach erosion occurred across Newport News and Hampton. In Virginia Beach, 15th street fishing pier was significantly damaged, and Buckroe and Lynnhaven Piers were destroyed. Significant erosion was also observed as far north as the middle peninsula and northern neck. In addition, many privately owned piers, as well as some public piers were damaged or destroyed by storm surge and/or wave impacts in this region. Eight deaths can be directly attributed to Isabel in the Wakefield area of responsibility, with 7 in Virginia. There were more than 15 deaths indirectly attributed to the storm.",69
