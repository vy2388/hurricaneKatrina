On Monday September 7 (Labor Day) a tropical disturbance in the western Gulf of Mexico was increasing the pressure gradient along the Texas coast. A weak cold front had pushed south to near the Red River by Tuesday evening. At 4pm Tuesday the disturbance was upgraded to a Tropical Depression located about 250 miles south of Galveston. On Wednesday morning the cold front had sagged down to a Lufkin to Dallas line with a 1022 high pressure centered over the Ohio Valley. At 4 PM the depression was upgraded to a Tropical Storm and given the name Frances. Winds along the upper Texas coast were from the ENE 20 to 30 mph with gusts nearing 40 mph. The poorly organized Tropical Storm center of circulation was still located about 250 miles south of Galveston with maximum sustained winds of 40 mph. On Thursday the storm remained disorganized and was located about 190 miles south of Galveston. On Thursday afternoon the storm had deepened and maximum sustained winds had increased to near 60 mph. The surface ridge of high pressure had now shifted to the southeast centered over Tennessee increasing the pressure gradient and the winds along the upper Texas coast. Early Friday morning Frances neared the Texas coast near Port O#Connor. Winds along the upper Texas coast continued at 30 to 40 mph sustained winds with gusts near 50 mph at times. Frances moved inland just southwest of Victoria and remained nearly stationary throughout the day on Friday. On Friday evening Frances began moving to the north northeast. At 7 PM Frances was downgraded to a Tropical Depression as it moved to the northeast of Victoria. At 10 PM the remnants of Frances was located about 65 miles west of Houston and it was longer being tracked by the National Hurricane Center.

Tides....
Most of the damage along the coastal communities can be attributed to the high tides that persisted for nearly two days. The high tides in Galveston Bay also enhanced the flooding problems experienced further inland by the heavy rains. A Coastal Flood Watch was issued Monday night concerning the possibility of high tides beginning on Tuesday with tides expected to run 3 feet above predicted levels.  On Tuesday afternoon the Coastal Flood Watch was updated to extend the watch into Wednesday with tides predicted to be 3 to 4 feet above predicted levels by Wednesday afternoon. At 4pm Tuesday Tropical Depression #6 formed in the Gulf of Mexico and a Tropical Storm Warning was issued for the Texas Coast from High Island to Brownsville. The Tropical Storm Warning implies Coastal Flood Warning is also in effect.. On Wednesday the tide forecast was updated with a forecast of tides 4 to 5 feet above predicted levels expected on Thursday. On Thursday the tide prediction for Friday called for tides increasing to levels of 4 to 6 feet above the predicted levels. 

On the beach front at Galveston Pleasure Pier the tides rose above 4 feet above MLLW on Wednesday afternoon (Sept 9) and remained above this level until the Friday afternoon (Sept. 11). The maximum level was reached on Thursday evening when the gauge read around 7 feet above MLLW or about 4.5 feet above the predicted levels. In Galveston Bay a similar even took place. At Eagle Point the tides rose above 4 feet above MLLW on Wednesday evening (October 9) and stayed above this level until after midnight on October 12. The peak height reached was around 5.7 feet above MLLW during the early morning hours of October 10 which is 4.7 feet above the predicted levels. 

Similar conditions were found along the entire upper Texas Coast from High Island to Matagorda and in the inland bays. With tides above 4 feet MLLW for 36 to 48 consecutive hours and winds in excess of 25 mph through the same period led to the destructive waves along the beach front.  These destructive waves resulted in most of the dune systems from High Island to Sargent Texas being almost completely destroyed.

Winds and Pressure..
Winds ranged from 25 to 35 knots (29 - 40 mph) for over 24 hours starting around midnight on the September 10 and continuing til the early morning of September 11. The strongest wind recorded was 47 knots (54 mph) at Galveston Scholes Field around 6pm on Sept. 10. Other peak winds recorded around the area included 46 knots (53 mph) at Palacios and 31 knots (36 mph) at Houston Intercontinental Airport.  at Palacios and 31 knots (36 mph) at Houston Intercontinental Airport.  

The lowest atmospheric pressure recorded was at Palacios when the barometer read 29.38 inches at 254 PM on Sept. 11. Galveston recorded 29.48 inches at 529 am Sept. 11.

Rainfall...
Rainfall from Tropical Storm Frances began effecting the coastal areas during the morning on Thursday and conditions slowly spread inland Thursday afternoon and further inland early Friday morning. Over 4 inches of rain fell over all of the Houston/Galveston County Warning area. Over 10 inches of rain was common along the coastal counties of Matagorda...Brazoria...Galveston and Chambers and also over inland counties including Harris...Polk...San Jacinto and Washington. With tides already running 4 to 6 feet above normal the runoff from the rains was not able to easily runoff into the bays thus resulting in more widespread flooding of inland creeks and bayous especially early Friday morning. 

River and Bayou Flooding...
September was an active month across the HSA with Tropical Storm Frances dumping 4 to 6 inches of rain over the region.  Large areas received 8 to 10 inches of rain with some areas receiving more than 12 inches.  The result was significant flooding in many areas.  Flooding was exacerbated in many areas by tides 4 to 6 feet above normal.  Significant rises occurred on the San Bernard River in Brazoria County from above Sweeny to the mouth on September 9th with flood stage exceeded on September 10th. This rise was mainly  due to strong tidal influence.  Significant rains began on September 10th and continued through the 12th. The majority of the rain occurred during the morning hours of September 11th as Frances made landfall.  

By daybreak September 11th  significant flooding was occurring in Harris County and the City of Houston.  Homes in Jersey Village and Woodland Trails in northwest Houston along White Oak Bayou were flooding by 6:00 am. Most subdivisions along White Oak Bayou experienced house flooding.  Homes were also flooded on Halls Bayou above I-45, on Brays Bayou at Lawndale near the confluence with the Houston Ship Channel, and on Armand Bayou near Spencer Highway in Pasadena.   I-10 between the West Loop and downtown Houston and I-45 near North Main Street were closed by 9:00 am due to flooding from Buffalo and White Oak Bayous.  State Highway 288 was closed due to flooding from Brays Bayou.  In all more than 1400 homes and businesses were damaged or destroyed in this event.

In Brazoria County Chocolate Bayou near Alvin exceeded its banks in the channel above FM 1462 to the mouth at Chocolate Bay.  Several minor roads were impacted by this flooding.

Significant flooding occurred on the San Bernard River above U.S. Highway 59 near Kendalton to the mouth.  Primary flooding above fm 442 near Boling was due to backwater on the tributaries of Peach and West Bernard Creeks in Wharton County.  While no homes were reported flooded several roads in the El Lobo subdivision were inundated.  A combination of strong tidal influence and heavy rain produced the rise in the channel above Sweeny to the mouth.  While low lying areas along the river were flooded the most significant impact was on barge traffic at the Phillips Petroleum Facility.

The Tres Palacios River in Matagorda County began rising at the rate of one foot an hour during the evening hours of September 10th resulting in moderate lowland flooding above State Highway 71 near Midfield to the mouth at Tres Palacios Bay.   Significant backwater up Juanita Creek, about one mile upstream from the gaging station FM 456 was also noted.  Several farm to market and county roads in Matagorda County were inundated by this flood.  There were no reports of homes flooded, however, several areas were isolated due to the flooded roadways.

Flooding on East Mustang Creek near Louise in Wharton County closed FM 647 for several hours on September 12th. Secondary and minor roads near the creek were also inundated. 

Several small, ungaged watersheds in Chambers, Galveston, Brazoria, Matagorda, Fort Bend, and Wharton Counties flooded.  This resulted in the closing of many farm to market and county with several homes and subdivisions threatened.  These included Dickinson Bayou in Galveston County, Oyster Creek in Brazoria County and Caney Creek in Matagorda County.

Water had receded on all but the San Bernard and Tres Palacios Rivers by the afternoon of September 12th.  There were no deaths of serious injuries due to river flooding associated with this event.  Galveston, Harris, Brazoria, and Matagorda Counties were declared disaster areas.

Impact and Damage...
Major impact and resultant damage occurred in Galveston, Harris, Brazoria and Matagorda counties of Texas. All four of these counties received a Presidential Disaster Declaration to help in the relief and recovery efforts. In these four counties total damage exceeded $286 million dollars. Most of this damage was along the coast and around Galveston Bay where high tides and winds destroyed dunes  and personal property. Nearly 100 single family homes were destroyed along the upper Texas coast by the high tides and battering waves. Other damage was a result of inland flooding due to heavy rains mainly in Harris county along White Oak and Buffalo Bayous. 

There were only 3 deaths that can be attributed to Tropical Storm Frances. A father and daughter drowned on Galveston Island while swimming in the surf during the day Monday. The third death occurred on Wednesday when a surfer drowned on the beaches of Surfside in Brazoria county while surfing the large waves.
 
Summary...
Tropical Storm Frances brought home how vulnerable the Texas Coast is to Tropical weather systems even if they do not achieve Hurricane Strength. Since Frances never achieved Hurricane strength the citizens along the upper Texas Coast never realized the damage that could result from #JUST A TROPICAL STORM#. With a long siege of high tides coupled with Tropical Storm Force Winds it was very similar to having a strong Category One Hurricane. The rains that accompanied the storm were fairly normal for a slow moving Tropical Storm but flooding was aggravated by the High Tides that were already in place when the heavy rains began.",11

Frances moved inland just southwest of Victoria and remained nearly stationary throughout the day on Friday. On Friday evening Frances began moving to the north northeast. At 7 PM Frances was downgraded to a Tropical Depression as it moved to the northeast of Victoria. At 10 PM the remnants of Frances was located about 65 miles west of Houston and it was longer being tracked by the National Hurricane Center.

Tides....
Most of the damage along the coastal communities can be attributed to the high tides that persisted for nearly two days. The high tides in Galveston Bay also enhanced the flooding problems experienced further inland by the heavy rains. A Coastal Flood Watch was issued Monday night concerning the possibility of high tides beginning on Tuesday with tides expected to run 3 feet above predicted levels.  On Tuesday afternoon the Coastal Flood Watch was updated to extend the watch into Wednesday with tides predicted to be 3 to 4 feet above predicted levels by Wednesday afternoon. At 4pm Tuesday Tropical Depression #6 formed in the Gulf of Mexico and a Tropical Storm Warning was issued for the Texas Coast from High Island to Brownsville. The Tropical Storm Warning implies Coastal Flood Warning is also in effect.. On Wednesday the tide forecast was updated with a forecast of tides 4 to 5 feet above predicted levels expected on Thursday. On Thursday the tide prediction for Friday called for tides increasing to levels of 4 to 6 feet above the predicted levels. 

On the beach front at Galveston Pleasure Pier the tides rose above 4 feet above MLLW on Wednesday afternoon (Sept 9) and remained above this level until the Friday afternoon (Sept. 11). The maximum level was reached on Thursday evening when the gauge read around 7 feet above MLLW or about 4.5 feet above the predicted levels. In Galveston Bay a similar even took place. At Eagle Point the tides rose above 4 feet above MLLW on Wednesday evening (October 9) and stayed above this level until after midnight on October 12. The peak height reached was around 5.7 feet above MLLW during the early morning hours of October 10 which is 4.7 feet above the predicted levels. 

Similar conditions were found along the entire upper Texas Coast from High Island to Matagorda and in the inland bays. With tides above 4 feet MLLW for 36 to 48 consecutive hours and winds in excess of 25 mph through the same period led to the destructive waves along the beach front.  These destructive waves resulted in most of the dune systems from High Island to Sargent Texas being almost completely destroyed.

Winds and Pressure..
Winds ranged from 25 to 35 knots (29 - 40 mph) for over 24 hours starting around midnight on the September 10 and continuing til the early morning of September 11. The strongest wind recorded was 47 knots (54 mph) at Galveston Scholes Field around 6pm on Sept. 10. Other peak winds recorded around the area included 46 knots (53 mph) at Palacios and 31 knots (36 mph) at Houston Intercontinental Airport.  at Palacios and 31 knots (36 mph) at Houston Intercontinental Airport.  

The lowest atmospheric pressure recorded was at Palacios when the barometer read 29.38 inches at 254 PM on Sept. 11. Galveston recorded 29.48 inches at 529 am Sept. 11.

Rainfall...
Rainfall from Tropical Storm Frances began effecting the coastal areas during the morning on Thursday and conditions slowly spread inland Thursday afternoon and further inland early Friday morning. Over 4 inches of rain fell over all of the Houston/Galveston County Warning area. Over 10 inches of rain was common along the coastal counties of Matagorda...Brazoria...Galveston and Chambers and also over inland counties including Harris...Polk...San Jacinto and Washington. With tides already running 4 to 6 feet above normal the runoff from the rains was not able to easily runoff into the bays thus resulting in more widespread flooding of inland creeks and bayous especially early Friday morning. 

River and Bayou Flooding...
September was an active month across the HSA with Tropical Storm Frances dumping 4 to 6 inches of rain over the region.  Large areas received 8 to 10 inches of rain with some areas receiving more than 12 inches.  The result was significant flooding in many areas.  Flooding was exacerbated in many areas by tides 4 to 6 feet above normal.  Significant rises occurred on the San Bernard River in Brazoria County from above Sweeny to the mouth on September 9th with flood stage exceeded on September 10th. This rise was mainly  due to strong tidal influence.  Significant rains began on September 10th and continued through the 12th. The majority of the rain occurred during the morning hours of September 11th as Frances made landfall.  

By daybreak September 11th  significant flooding was occurring in Harris County and the City of Houston.  Homes in Jersey Village and Woodland Trails in northwest Houston along White Oak Bayou were flooding by 6:00 am. Most subdivisions along White Oak Bayou experienced house flooding.  Homes were also flooded on Halls Bayou above I-45, on Brays Bayou at Lawndale near the confluence with the Houston Ship Channel, and on Armand Bayou near Spencer Highway in Pasadena.   I-10 between the West Loop and downtown Houston and I-45 near North Main Street were closed by 9:00 am due to flooding from Buffalo and White Oak Bayous.  State Highway 288 was closed due to flooding from Brays Bayou.  In all more than 1400 homes and businesses were damaged or destroyed in this event.

In Brazoria County Chocolate Bayou near Alvin exceeded its banks in the channel above FM 1462 to the mouth at Chocolate Bay.  Several minor roads were impacted by this flooding.

Significant flooding occurred on the San Bernard River above U.S. Highway 59 near Kendalton to the mouth.  Primary flooding above fm 442 near Boling was due to backwater on the tributaries of Peach and West Bernard Creeks in Wharton County.  While no homes were reported flooded several roads in the El Lobo subdivision were inundated.  A combination of strong tidal influence and heavy rain produced the rise in the channel above Sweeny to the mouth.  While low lying areas along the river were flooded the most significant impact was on barge traffic at the Phillips Petroleum Facility.

The Tres Palacios River in Matagorda County began rising at the rate of one foot an hour during the evening hours of September 10th resulting in moderate lowland flooding above State Highway 71 near Midfield to the mouth at Tres Palacios Bay.   Significant backwater up Juanita Creek, about one mile upstream from the gaging station FM 456 was also noted.  Several farm to market and county roads in Matagorda County were inundated by this flood.  There were no reports of homes flooded, however, several areas were isolated due to the flooded roadways.

Flooding on East Mustang Creek near Louise in Wharton County closed FM 647 for several hours on September 12th. Secondary and minor roads near the creek were also inundated. 

Several small, ungaged watersheds in Chambers, Galveston, Brazoria, Matagorda, Fort Bend, and Wharton Counties flooded.  This resulted in the closing of many farm to market and county with several homes and subdivisions threatened.  These included Dickinson Bayou in Galveston County, Oyster Creek in Brazoria County and Caney Creek in Matagorda County.

Water had receded on all but the San Bernard and Tres Palacios Rivers by the afternoon of September 12th.  There were no deaths of serious injuries due to river flooding associated with this event.  Galveston, Harris, Brazoria, and Matagorda Counties were declared disaster areas.

Impact and Damage...
Major impact and resultant damage occurred in Galveston, Harris, Brazoria and Matagorda counties of Texas. All four of these counties received a Presidential Disaster Declaration to help in the relief and recovery efforts. In these four counties total damage exceeded $286 million dollars. Most of this damage was along the coast and around Galveston Bay where high tides and winds destroyed dunes  and personal property. Nearly 100 single family homes were destroyed along the upper Texas coast by the high tides and battering waves. Other damage was a result of inland flooding due to heavy rains mainly in Harris county along White Oak and Buffalo Bayous. 

There were only 3 deaths that can be attributed to Tropical Storm Frances. A father and daughter drowned on Galveston Island while swimming in the surf during the day Monday. The third death occurred on Wednesday when a surfer drowned on the beaches of Surfside in Brazoria county while surfing the large waves.
 
Summary...
Tropical Storm Frances brought home how vulnerable the Texas Coast is to Tropical weather systems even if they do not achieve Hurricane Strength. Since Frances never achieved Hurricane strength the citizens along the upper Texas Coast never realized the damage that could result from #JUST A TROPICAL STORM#. With a long siege of high tides coupled with Tropical Storm Force Winds it was very similar to having a strong Category One Hurricane. The rains that accompanied the storm were fairly normal for a slow moving Tropical Storm but flooding was aggravated by the High Tides that were already in place when the heavy rains began.",13

Winds ranged from 25 to 35 knots (29 - 40 mph) for over 24 hours starting around midnight on the September 10 and continuing til the early morning of September 11. The strongest wind recorded was 47 knots (54 mph) at Galveston Scholes Field around 6pm on Sept. 10. Other peak winds recorded around the area included 46 knots (53 mph) at Palacios and 31 knots (36 mph) at Houston Intercontinental Airport.  at Palacios and 31 knots (36 mph) at Houston Intercontinental Airport.  

The lowest atmospheric pressure recorded was at Palacios when the barometer read 29.38 inches at 254 PM on Sept. 11. Galveston recorded 29.48 inches at 529 am Sept. 11.

Rainfall...
Rainfall from Tropical Storm Frances began effecting the coastal areas during the morning on Thursday and conditions slowly spread inland Thursday afternoon and further inland early Friday morning. Over 4 inches of rain fell over all of the Houston/Galveston County Warning area. Over 10 inches of rain was common along the coastal counties of Matagorda...Brazoria...Galveston and Chambers and also over inland counties including Harris...Polk...San Jacinto and Washington. With tides already running 4 to 6 feet above normal the runoff from the rains was not able to easily runoff into the bays thus resulting in more widespread flooding of inland creeks and bayous especially early Friday morning. 

River and Bayou Flooding...
September was an active month across the HSA with Tropical Storm Frances dumping 4 to 6 inches of rain over the region.  Large areas received 8 to 10 inches of rain with some areas receiving more than 12 inches.  The result was significant flooding in many areas.  Flooding was exacerbated in many areas by tides 4 to 6 feet above normal.  Significant rises occurred on the San Bernard River in Brazoria County from above Sweeny to the mouth on September 9th with flood stage exceeded on September 10th. This rise was mainly  due to strong tidal influence.  Significant rains began on September 10th and continued through the 12th. The majority of the rain occurred during the morning hours of September 11th as Frances made landfall.  

By daybreak September 11th  significant flooding was occurring in Harris County and the City of Houston.  Homes in Jersey Village and Woodland Trails in northwest Houston along White Oak Bayou were flooding by 6:00 am. Most subdivisions along White Oak Bayou experienced house flooding.  Homes were also flooded on Halls Bayou above I-45, on Brays Bayou at Lawndale near the confluence with the Houston Ship Channel, and on Armand Bayou near Spencer Highway in Pasadena.   I-10 between the West Loop and downtown Houston and I-45 near North Main Street were closed by 9:00 am due to flooding from Buffalo and White Oak Bayous.  State Highway 288 was closed due to flooding from Brays Bayou.  In all more than 1400 homes and businesses were damaged or destroyed in this event.

In Brazoria County Chocolate Bayou near Alvin exceeded its banks in the channel above FM 1462 to the mouth at Chocolate Bay.  Several minor roads were impacted by this flooding.

Significant flooding occurred on the San Bernard River above U.S. Highway 59 near Kendalton to the mouth.  Primary flooding above fm 442 near Boling was due to backwater on the tributaries of Peach and West Bernard Creeks in Wharton County.  While no homes were reported flooded several roads in the El Lobo subdivision were inundated.  A combination of strong tidal influence and heavy rain produced the rise in the channel above Sweeny to the mouth.  While low lying areas along the river were flooded the most significant impact was on barge traffic at the Phillips Petroleum Facility.

The Tres Palacios River in Matagorda County began rising at the rate of one foot an hour during the evening hours of September 10th resulting in moderate lowland flooding above State Highway 71 near Midfield to the mouth at Tres Palacios Bay.   Significant backwater up Juanita Creek, about one mile upstream from the gaging station FM 456 was also noted.  Several farm to market and county roads in Matagorda County were inundated by this flood.  There were no reports of homes flooded, however, several areas were isolated due to the flooded roadways.

Flooding on East Mustang Creek near Louise in Wharton County closed FM 647 for several hours on September 12th. Secondary and minor roads near the creek were also inundated. 

Several small, ungaged watersheds in Chambers, Galveston, Brazoria, Matagorda, Fort Bend, and Wharton Counties flooded.  This resulted in the closing of many farm to market and county with several homes and subdivisions threatened.  These included Dickinson Bayou in Galveston County, Oyster Creek in Brazoria County and Caney Creek in Matagorda County.

Water had receded on all but the San Bernard and Tres Palacios Rivers by the afternoon of September 12th.  There were no deaths of serious injuries due to river flooding associated with this event.  Galveston, Harris, Brazoria, and Matagorda Counties were declared disaster areas.

Impact and Damage...
Major impact and resultant damage occurred in Galveston, Harris, Brazoria and Matagorda counties of Texas. All four of these counties received a Presidential Disaster Declaration to help in the relief and recovery efforts. In these four counties total damage exceeded $286 million dollars. Most of this damage was along the coast and around Galveston Bay where high tides and winds destroyed dunes  and personal property. Nearly 100 single family homes were destroyed along the upper Texas coast by the high tides and battering waves. Other damage was a result of inland flooding due to heavy rains mainly in Harris county along White Oak and Buffalo Bayous. 

There were only 3 deaths that can be attributed to Tropical Storm Frances. A father and daughter drowned on Galveston Island while swimming in the surf during the day Monday. The third death occurred on Wednesday when a surfer drowned on the beaches of Surfside in Brazoria county while surfing the large waves.
 
Summary...
Tropical Storm Frances brought home how vulnerable the Texas Coast is to Tropical weather systems even if they do not achieve Hurricane Strength. Since Frances never achieved Hurricane strength the citizens along the upper Texas Coast never realized the damage that could result from #JUST A TROPICAL STORM#. With a long siege of high tides coupled with Tropical Storm Force Winds it was very similar to having a strong Category One Hurricane. The rains that accompanied the storm were fairly normal for a slow moving Tropical Storm but flooding was aggravated by the High Tides that were already in place when the heavy rains began.",16

On Monday September 7 (Labor Day) a tropical disturbance in the western Gulf of Mexico was increasing the pressure gradient along the Texas coast. A weak cold front had pushed south to near the Red River by Tuesday evening. At 4pm Tuesday the disturbance was upgraded to a Tropical Depression located about 250 miles south of Galveston. On Wednesday morning the cold front had sagged down to a Lufkin to Dallas line with a 1022 high pressure centered over the Ohio Valley. At 4 PM the depression was upgraded to a Tropical Storm and given the name Frances. Winds along the upper Texas coast were from the ENE 20 to 30 mph with gusts nearing 40 mph. The poorly organized Tropical Storm center of circulation was still located about 250 miles south of Galveston with maximum sustained winds of 40 mph. On Thursday the storm remained disorganized and was located about 190 miles south of Galveston. On Thursday afternoon the storm had deepened and maximum sustained winds had increased to near 60 mph. The surface ridge of high pressure had now shifted to the southeast centered over Tennessee increasing the pressure gradient and the winds along the upper Texas coast. Early Friday morning Frances neared the Texas coast near Port O#Connor. Winds along the upper Texas coast continued at 30 to 40 mph sustained winds with gusts near 50 mph at times. Frances moved inland just southwest of Victoria and remained nearly stationary throughout the day on Friday. On Friday evening Frances began moving to the north northeast. At 7 PM Frances was downgraded to a Tropical Depression as it moved to the northeast of Victoria. At 10 PM the remnants of Frances was located about 65 miles west of Houston and it was longer being tracked by the National Hurricane Center.

Tides....
Most of the damage along the coastal communities can be attributed to the high tides that persisted for nearly two days. The high tides in Galveston Bay also enhanced the flooding problems experienced further inland by the heavy rains. A Coastal Flood Watch was issued Monday night concerning the possibility of high tides beginning on Tuesday with tides expected to run 3 feet above predicted levels.  On Tuesday afternoon the Coastal Flood Watch was updated to extend the watch into Wednesday with tides predicted to be 3 to 4 feet above predicted levels by Wednesday afternoon. At 4pm Tuesday Tropical Depression #6 formed in the Gulf of Mexico and a Tropical Storm Warning was issued for the Texas Coast from High Island to Brownsville. The Tropical Storm Warning implies Coastal Flood Warning is also in effect.. On Wednesday the tide forecast was updated with a forecast of tides 4 to 5 feet above predicted levels expected on Thursday. On Thursday the tide prediction for Friday called for tides increasing to levels of 4 to 6 feet above the predicted levels. 

On the beach front at Galveston Pleasure Pier the tides rose above 4 feet above MLLW on Wednesday afternoon (Sept 9) and remained above this level until the Friday afternoon (Sept. 11).

I-10 between the West Loop and downtown Houston and I-45 near North Main Street were closed by 9:00 am due to flooding from Buffalo and White Oak Bayous.  State Highway 288 was closed due to flooding from Brays Bayou.  In all more than 1400 homes and businesses were damaged or destroyed in this event.

In Brazoria County Chocolate Bayou near Alvin exceeded its banks in the channel above FM 1462 to the mouth at Chocolate Bay.  Several minor roads were impacted by this flooding.

Significant flooding occurred on the San Bernard River above U.S. Highway 59 near Kendalton to the mouth.  Primary flooding above fm 442 near Boling was due to backwater on the tributaries of Peach and West Bernard Creeks in Wharton County.  While no homes were reported flooded several roads in the El Lobo subdivision were inundated.  A combination of strong tidal influence and heavy rain produced the rise in the channel above Sweeny to the mouth.  While low lying areas along the river were flooded the most significant impact was on barge traffic at the Phillips Petroleum Facility.

The Tres Palacios River in Matagorda County began rising at the rate of one foot an hour during the evening hours of September 10th resulting in moderate lowland flooding above State Highway 71 near Midfield to the mouth at Tres Palacios Bay.   Significant backwater up Juanita Creek, about one mile upstream from the gaging station FM 456 was also noted.  Several farm to market and county roads in Matagorda County were inundated by this flood.  There were no reports of homes flooded, however, several areas were isolated due to the flooded roadways.

Flooding on East Mustang Creek near Louise in Wharton County closed FM 647 for several hours on September 12th. Secondary and minor roads near the creek were also inundated. 

Several small, ungaged watersheds in Chambers, Galveston, Brazoria, Matagorda, Fort Bend, and Wharton Counties flooded.  This resulted in the closing of many farm to market and county with several homes and subdivisions threatened.  These included Dickinson Bayou in Galveston County, Oyster Creek in Brazoria County and Caney Creek in Matagorda County.

Water had receded on all but the San Bernard and Tres Palacios Rivers by the afternoon of September 12th.  There were no deaths of serious injuries due to river flooding associated with this event.  Galveston, Harris, Brazoria, and Matagorda Counties were declared disaster areas.

Impact and Damage...
Major impact and resultant damage occurred in Galveston, Harris, Brazoria and Matagorda counties of Texas. All four of these counties received a Presidential Disaster Declaration to help in the relief and recovery efforts. In these four counties total damage exceeded $286 million dollars. Most of this damage was along the coast and around Galveston Bay where high tides and winds destroyed dunes  and personal property. Nearly 100 single family homes were destroyed along the upper Texas coast by the high tides and battering waves. Other damage was a result of inland flooding due to heavy rains mainly in Harris county along White Oak and Buffalo Bayous. 

There were only 3 deaths that can be attributed to Tropical Storm Frances. A father and daughter drowned on Galveston Island while swimming in the surf during the day Monday. The third death occurred on Wednesday when a surfer drowned on the beaches of Surfside in Brazoria county while surfing the large waves.
 
Summary...
Tropical Storm Frances brought home how vulnerable the Texas Coast is to Tropical weather systems even if they do not achieve Hurricane Strength. Since Frances never achieved Hurricane strength the citizens along the upper Texas Coast never realized the damage that could result from #JUST A TROPICAL STORM#. With a long siege of high tides coupled with Tropical Storm Force Winds it was very similar to having a strong Category One Hurricane. The rains that accompanied the storm were fairly normal for a slow moving Tropical Storm but flooding was aggravated by the High Tides that were already in place when the heavy rains began.",19

On Monday September 7 (Labor Day) a tropical disturbance in the western Gulf of Mexico was increasing the pressure gradient along the Texas coast. A weak cold front had pushed south to near the Red River by Tuesday evening. At 4pm Tuesday the disturbance was upgraded to a Tropical Depression located about 250 miles south of Galveston. On Wednesday morning the cold front had sagged down to a Lufkin to Dallas line with a 1022 high pressure centered over the Ohio Valley. At 4 PM the depression was upgraded to a Tropical Storm and given the name Frances. Winds along the upper Texas coast were from the ENE 20 to 30 mph with gusts nearing 40 mph. The poorly organized Tropical Storm center of circulation was still located about 250 miles south of Galveston with maximum sustained winds of 40 mph. On Thursday the storm remained disorganized and was located about 190 miles south of Galveston. On Thursday afternoon the storm had deepened and maximum sustained winds had increased to near 60 mph. The surface ridge of high pressure had now shifted to the southeast centered over Tennessee increasing the pressure gradient and the winds along the upper Texas coast. Early Friday morning Frances neared the Texas coast near Port O#Connor. Winds along the upper Texas coast continued at 30 to 40 mph sustained winds with gusts near 50 mph at times. Frances moved inland just southwest of Victoria and remained nearly stationary throughout the day on Friday. On Friday evening Frances began moving to the north northeast. At 7 PM Frances was downgraded to a Tropical Depression as it moved to the northeast of Victoria. At 10 PM the remnants of Frances was located about 65 miles west of Houston and it was longer being tracked by the National Hurricane Center.

Tides....
Most of the damage along the coastal communities can be attributed to the high tides that persisted for nearly two days. The high tides in Galveston Bay also enhanced the flooding problems experienced further inland by the heavy rains. A Coastal Flood Watch was issued Monday night concerning the possibility of high tides beginning on Tuesday with tides expected to run 3 feet above predicted levels.  On Tuesday afternoon the Coastal Flood Watch was updated to extend the watch into Wednesday with tides predicted to be 3 to 4 feet above predicted levels by Wednesday afternoon. At 4pm Tuesday Tropical Depression #6 formed in the Gulf of Mexico and a Tropical Storm Warning was issued for the Texas Coast from High Island to Brownsville. The Tropical Storm Warning implies Coastal Flood Warning is also in effect.. On Wednesday the tide forecast was updated with a forecast of tides 4 to 5 feet above predicted levels expected on Thursday. On Thursday the tide prediction for Friday called for tides increasing to levels of 4 to 6 feet above the predicted levels. 

On the beach front at Galveston Pleasure Pier the tides rose above 4 feet above MLLW on Wednesday afternoon (Sept 9) and remained above this level until the Friday afternoon (Sept. 11). The maximum level was reached on Thursday evening when the gauge read around 7 feet above MLLW or about 4.5 feet above the predicted levels. In Galveston Bay a similar even took place. At Eagle Point the tides rose above 4 feet above MLLW on Wednesday evening (October 9) and stayed above this level until after midnight on October 12. The peak height reached was around 5.7 feet above MLLW during the early morning hours of October 10 which is 4.7 feet above the predicted levels. 

Similar conditions were found along the entire upper Texas Coast from High Island to Matagorda and in the inland bays. With tides above 4 feet MLLW for 36 to 48 consecutive hours and winds in excess of 25 mph through the same period led to the destructive waves along the beach front.  These destructive waves resulted in most of the dune systems from High Island to Sargent Texas being almost completely destroyed.

Winds and Pressure..
Winds ranged from 25 to 35 knots (29 - 40 mph) for over 24 hours starting around midnight on the September 10 and continuing til the early morning of September 11.

Rainfall...
Rainfall from Tropical Storm Frances began effecting the coastal areas during the morning on Thursday and conditions slowly spread inland Thursday afternoon and further inland early Friday morning. Over 4 inches of rain fell over all of the Houston/Galveston County Warning area. Over 10 inches of rain was common along the coastal counties of Matagorda...Brazoria...Galveston and Chambers and also over inland counties including Harris...Polk...San Jacinto and Washington. With tides already running 4 to 6 feet above normal the runoff from the rains was not able to easily runoff into the bays thus resulting in more widespread flooding of inland creeks and bayous especially early Friday morning. 

River and Bayou Flooding...

Large areas received 8 to 10 inches of rain with some areas receiving more than 12 inches.  The result was significant flooding in many areas.  Flooding was exacerbated in many areas by tides 4 to 6 feet above normal.  Significant rises occurred on the San Bernard River in Brazoria County from above Sweeny to the mouth on September 9th with flood stage exceeded on September 10th. This rise was mainly  due to strong tidal influence.  Significant rains began on September 10th and continued through the 12th. The majority of the rain occurred during the morning hours of September 11th as Frances made landfall.  

By daybreak September 11th  significant flooding was occurring in Harris County and the City of Houston.

All four of these counties received a Presidential Disaster Declaration to help in the relief and recovery efforts. In these four counties total damage exceeded $286 million dollars. Most of this damage was along the coast and around Galveston Bay where high tides and winds destroyed dunes  and personal property. Nearly 100 single family homes were destroyed along the upper Texas coast by the high tides and battering waves. Other damage was a result of inland flooding due to heavy rains mainly in Harris county along White Oak and Buffalo Bayous. 

There were only 3 deaths that can be attributed to Tropical Storm Frances. A father and daughter drowned on Galveston Island while swimming in the surf during the day Monday. The third death occurred on Wednesday when a surfer drowned on the beaches of Surfside in Brazoria county while surfing the large waves.
 
Summary...
Tropical Storm Frances brought home how vulnerable the Texas Coast is to Tropical weather systems even if they do not achieve Hurricane Strength. Since Frances never achieved Hurricane strength the citizens along the upper Texas Coast never realized the damage that could result from #JUST A TROPICAL STORM#. With a long siege of high tides coupled with Tropical Storm Force Winds it was very similar to having a strong Category One Hurricane. The rains that accompanied the storm were fairly normal for a slow moving Tropical Storm but flooding was aggravated by the High Tides that were already in place when the heavy rains began.",22

On Monday September 7 (Labor Day) a tropical disturbance in the western Gulf of Mexico was increasing the pressure gradient along the Texas coast. A weak cold front had pushed south to near the Red River by Tuesday evening. At 4pm Tuesday the disturbance was upgraded to a Tropical Depression located about 250 miles south of Galveston. On Wednesday morning the cold front had sagged down to a Lufkin to Dallas line with a 1022 high pressure centered over the Ohio Valley. At 4 PM the depression was upgraded to a Tropical Storm and given the name Frances. Winds along the upper Texas coast were from the ENE 20 to 30 mph with gusts nearing 40 mph. The poorly organized Tropical Storm center of circulation was still located about 250 miles south of Galveston with maximum sustained winds of 40 mph. On Thursday the storm remained disorganized and was located about 190 miles south of Galveston. On Thursday afternoon the storm had deepened and maximum sustained winds had increased to near 60 mph. The surface ridge of high pressure had now shifted to the southeast centered over Tennessee increasing the pressure gradient and the winds along the upper Texas coast. Early Friday morning Frances neared the Texas coast near Port O#Connor. Winds along the upper Texas coast continued at 30 to 40 mph sustained winds with gusts near 50 mph at times. Frances moved inland just southwest of Victoria and remained nearly stationary throughout the day on Friday. On Friday evening Frances began moving to the north northeast. At 7 PM Frances was downgraded to a Tropical Depression as it moved to the northeast of Victoria. At 10 PM the remnants of Frances was located about 65 miles west of Houston and it was longer being tracked by the National Hurricane Center.

Tides....
Most of the damage along the coastal communities can be attributed to the high tides that persisted for nearly two days. The high tides in Galveston Bay also enhanced the flooding problems experienced further inland by the heavy rains. A Coastal Flood Watch was issued Monday night concerning the possibility of high tides beginning on Tuesday with tides expected to run 3 feet above predicted levels.  On Tuesday afternoon the Coastal Flood Watch was updated to extend the watch into Wednesday with tides predicted to be 3 to 4 feet above predicted levels by Wednesday afternoon. At 4pm Tuesday Tropical Depression #6 formed in the Gulf of Mexico and a Tropical Storm Warning was issued for the Texas Coast from High Island to Brownsville. The Tropical Storm Warning implies Coastal Flood Warning is also in effect.. On Wednesday the tide forecast was updated with a forecast of tides 4 to 5 feet above predicted levels expected on Thursday. On Thursday the tide prediction for Friday called for tides increasing to levels of 4 to 6 feet above the predicted levels. 

On the beach front at Galveston Pleasure Pier the tides rose above 4 feet above MLLW on Wednesday afternoon (Sept 9) and remained above this level until the Friday afternoon (Sept. 11). The maximum level was reached on Thursday evening when the gauge read around 7 feet above MLLW or about 4.5 feet above the predicted levels. In Galveston Bay a similar even took place. At Eagle Point the tides rose above 4 feet above MLLW on Wednesday evening (October 9) and stayed above this level until after midnight on October 12. The peak height reached was around 5.7 feet above MLLW during the early morning hours of October 10 which is 4.7 feet above the predicted levels. 

Similar conditions were found along the entire upper Texas Coast from High Island to Matagorda and in the inland bays. With tides above 4 feet MLLW for 36 to 48 consecutive hours and winds in excess of 25 mph through the same period led to the destructive waves along the beach front.  These destructive waves resulted in most of the dune systems from High Island to Sargent Texas being almost completely destroyed.

Winds and Pressure..
Winds ranged from 25 to 35 knots (29 - 40 mph) for over 24 hours starting around midnight on the September 10 and continuing til the early morning of September 11. The strongest wind recorded was 47 knots (54 mph) at Galveston Scholes Field around 6pm on Sept. 10. Other peak winds recorded around the area included 46 knots (53 mph) at Palacios and 31 knots (36 mph) at Houston Intercontinental Airport.  at Palacios and 31 knots (36 mph) at Houston Intercontinental Airport.  

The lowest atmospheric pressure recorded was at Palacios when the barometer read 29.38 inches at 254 PM on Sept. 11. Galveston recorded 29.48 inches at 529 am Sept. 11.

Rainfall...
Rainfall from Tropical Storm Frances began effecting the coastal areas during the morning on Thursday and conditions slowly spread inland Thursday afternoon and further inland early Friday morning. Over 4 inches of rain fell over all of the Houston/Galveston County Warning area. Over 10 inches of rain was common along the coastal counties of Matagorda...Brazoria...Galveston and Chambers and also over inland counties including Harris...Polk...San Jacinto and Washington. With tides already running 4 to 6 feet above normal the runoff from the rains was not able to easily runoff into the bays thus resulting in more widespread flooding of inland creeks and bayous especially early Friday morning. 

River and Bayou Flooding...
September was an active month across the HSA with Tropical Storm Frances dumping 4 to 6 inches of rain over the region.  Large areas received 8 to 10 inches of rain with some areas receiving more than 12 inches.  The result was significant flooding in many areas.  Flooding was exacerbated in many areas by tides 4 to 6 feet above normal.  Significant rises occurred on the San Bernard River in Brazoria County from above Sweeny to the mouth on September 9th with flood stage exceeded on September 10th. This rise was mainly  due to strong tidal influence.  Significant rains began on September 10th and continued through the 12th. The majority of the rain occurred during the morning hours of September 11th as Frances made landfall.  

By daybreak September 11th  significant flooding was occurring in Harris County and the City of Houston.  Homes in Jersey Village and Woodland Trails in northwest Houston along White Oak Bayou were flooding by 6:00 am. Most subdivisions along White Oak Bayou experienced house flooding.  Homes were also flooded on Halls Bayou above I-45, on Brays Bayou at Lawndale near the confluence with the Houston Ship Channel, and on Armand Bayou near Spencer Highway in Pasadena.   I-10 between the West Loop and downtown Houston and I-45 near North Main Street were closed by 9:00 am due to flooding from Buffalo and White Oak Bayous.  State Highway 288 was closed due to flooding from Brays Bayou.  In all more than 1400 homes and businesses were damaged or destroyed in this event.

In Brazoria County Chocolate Bayou near Alvin exceeded its banks in the channel above FM 1462 to the mouth at Chocolate Bay.  Several minor roads were impacted by this flooding.

Significant flooding occurred on the San Bernard River above U.S. Highway 59 near Kendalton to the mouth.  Primary flooding above fm 442 near Boling was due to backwater on the tributaries of Peach and West Bernard Creeks in Wharton County.  While no homes were reported flooded several roads in the El Lobo subdivision were inundated.  A combination of strong tidal influence and heavy rain produced the rise in the channel above Sweeny to the mouth.  While low lying areas along the river were flooded the most significant impact was on barge traffic at the Phillips Petroleum Facility.

The Tres Palacios River in Matagorda County began rising at the rate of one foot an hour during the evening hours of September 10th resulting in moderate lowland flooding above State Highway 71 near Midfield to the mouth at Tres Palacios Bay.   Significant backwater up Juanita Creek, about one mile upstream from the gaging station FM 456 was also noted.  Several farm to market and county roads in Matagorda County were inundated by this flood.  There were no reports of homes flooded, however, several areas were isolated due to the flooded roadways.

Flooding on East Mustang Creek near Louise in Wharton County closed FM 647 for several hours on September 12th. Secondary and minor roads near the creek were also inundated. 

Several small, ungaged watersheds in Chambers, Galveston, Brazoria, Matagorda, Fort Bend, and Wharton Counties flooded.  This resulted in the closing of many farm to market and county with several homes and subdivisions threatened.  These included Dickinson Bayou in Galveston County, Oyster Creek in Brazoria County and Caney Creek in Matagorda County.

Water had receded on all but the San Bernard and Tres Palacios Rivers by the afternoon of September 12th.  There were no deaths of serious injuries due to river flooding associated with this event.  Galveston, Harris, Brazoria, and Matagorda Counties were declared disaster areas.

The surface ridge of high pressure had now shifted to the southeast centered over Tennessee increasing the pressure gradient and the winds along the upper Texas coast. Early Friday morning Frances neared the Texas coast near Port O#Connor. Winds along the upper Texas coast continued at 30 to 40 mph sustained winds with gusts near 50 mph at times. Frances moved inland just southwest of Victoria and remained nearly stationary throughout the day on Friday. On Friday evening Frances began moving to the north northeast. At 7 PM Frances was downgraded to a Tropical Depression as it moved to the northeast of Victoria. At 10 PM the remnants of Frances was located about 65 miles west of Houston and it was longer being tracked by the National Hurricane Center.

Tides....
Most of the damage along the coastal communities can be attributed to the high tides that persisted for nearly two days. The high tides in Galveston Bay also enhanced the flooding problems experienced further inland by the heavy rains. A Coastal Flood Watch was issued Monday night concerning the possibility of high tides beginning on Tuesday with tides expected to run 3 feet above predicted levels.  On Tuesday afternoon the Coastal Flood Watch was updated to extend the watch into Wednesday with tides predicted to be 3 to 4 feet above predicted levels by Wednesday afternoon. At 4pm Tuesday Tropical Depression #6 formed in the Gulf of Mexico and a Tropical Storm Warning was issued for the Texas Coast from High Island to Brownsville. The Tropical Storm Warning implies Coastal Flood Warning is also in effect.. On Wednesday the tide forecast was updated with a forecast of tides 4 to 5 feet above predicted levels expected on Thursday. On Thursday the tide prediction for Friday called for tides increasing to levels of 4 to 6 feet above the predicted levels. 

On the beach front at Galveston Pleasure Pier the tides rose above 4 feet above MLLW on Wednesday afternoon (Sept 9) and remained above this level until the Friday afternoon (Sept. 11). The maximum level was reached on Thursday evening when the gauge read around 7 feet above MLLW or about 4.5 feet above the predicted levels. In Galveston Bay a similar even took place. At Eagle Point the tides rose above 4 feet above MLLW on Wednesday evening (October 9) and stayed above this level until after midnight on October 12. The peak height reached was around 5.7 feet above MLLW during the early morning hours of October 10 which is 4.7 feet above the predicted levels. 

Similar conditions were found along the entire upper Texas Coast from High Island to Matagorda and in the inland bays. With tides above 4 feet MLLW for 36 to 48 consecutive hours and winds in excess of 25 mph through the same period led to the destructive waves along the beach front.  These destructive waves resulted in most of the dune systems from High Island to Sargent Texas being almost completely destroyed.

Winds and Pressure..
Winds ranged from 25 to 35 knots (29 - 40 mph) for over 24 hours starting around midnight on the September 10 and continuing til the early morning of September 11. The strongest wind recorded was 47 knots (54 mph) at Galveston Scholes Field around 6pm on Sept. 10. Other peak winds recorded around the area included 46 knots (53 mph) at Palacios and 31 knots (36 mph) at Houston Intercontinental Airport.  at Palacios and 31 knots (36 mph) at Houston Intercontinental Airport.  

The lowest atmospheric pressure recorded was at Palacios when the barometer read 29.38 inches at 254 PM on Sept. 11. Galveston recorded 29.48 inches at 529 am Sept. 11.

Rainfall...
Rainfall from Tropical Storm Frances began effecting the coastal areas during the morning on Thursday and conditions slowly spread inland Thursday afternoon and further inland early Friday morning. Over 4 inches of rain fell over all of the Houston/Galveston County Warning area. Over 10 inches of rain was common along the coastal counties of Matagorda...Brazoria...Galveston and Chambers and also over inland counties including Harris...Polk...San Jacinto and Washington. With tides already running 4 to 6 feet above normal the runoff from the rains was not able to easily runoff into the bays thus resulting in more widespread flooding of inland creeks and bayous especially early Friday morning. 

River and Bayou Flooding...
September was an active month across the HSA with Tropical Storm Frances dumping 4 to 6 inches of rain over the region.  Large areas received 8 to 10 inches of rain with some areas receiving more than 12 inches.  The result was significant flooding in many areas.  Flooding was exacerbated in many areas by tides 4 to 6 feet above normal.  Significant rises occurred on the San Bernard River in Brazoria County from above Sweeny to the mouth on September 9th with flood stage exceeded on September 10th. This rise was mainly  due to strong tidal influence.  Significant rains began on September 10th and continued through the 12th. The majority of the rain occurred during the morning hours of September 11th as Frances made landfall.  

By daybreak September 11th  significant flooding was occurring in Harris County and the City of Houston.  Homes in Jersey Village and Woodland Trails in northwest Houston along White Oak Bayou were flooding by 6:00 am. Most subdivisions along White Oak Bayou experienced house flooding.  Homes were also flooded on Halls Bayou above I-45, on Brays Bayou at Lawndale near the confluence with the Houston Ship Channel, and on Armand Bayou near Spencer Highway in Pasadena.   I-10 between the West Loop and downtown Houston and I-45 near North Main Street were closed by 9:00 am due to flooding from Buffalo and White Oak Bayous.  State Highway 288 was closed due to flooding from Brays Bayou.  In all more than 1400 homes and businesses were damaged or destroyed in this event.

In Brazoria County Chocolate Bayou near Alvin exceeded its banks in the channel above FM 1462 to the mouth at Chocolate Bay.  Several minor roads were impacted by this flooding.

Significant flooding occurred on the San Bernard River above U.S. Highway 59 near Kendalton to the mouth.  Primary flooding above fm 442 near Boling was due to backwater on the tributaries of Peach and West Bernard Creeks in Wharton County.  While no homes were reported flooded several roads in the El Lobo subdivision were inundated.  A combination of strong tidal influence and heavy rain produced the rise in the channel above Sweeny to the mouth.  While low lying areas along the river were flooded the most significant impact was on barge traffic at the Phillips Petroleum Facility.

The Tres Palacios River in Matagorda County began rising at the rate of one foot an hour during the evening hours of September 10th resulting in moderate lowland flooding above State Highway 71 near Midfield to the mouth at Tres Palacios Bay.   Significant backwater up Juanita Creek, about one mile upstream from the gaging station FM 456 was also noted.  Several farm to market and county roads in Matagorda County were inundated by this flood.  There were no reports of homes flooded, however, several areas were isolated due to the flooded roadways.

Flooding on East Mustang Creek near Louise in Wharton County closed FM 647 for several hours on September 12th. Secondary and minor roads near the creek were also inundated. 

Several small, ungaged watersheds in Chambers, Galveston, Brazoria, Matagorda, Fort Bend, and Wharton Counties flooded.  This resulted in the closing of many farm to market and county with several homes and subdivisions threatened.  These included Dickinson Bayou in Galveston County, Oyster Creek in Brazoria County and Caney Creek in Matagorda County.

Water had receded on all but the San Bernard and Tres Palacios Rivers by the afternoon of September 12th.  There were no deaths of serious injuries due to river flooding associated with this event.  Galveston, Harris, Brazoria, and Matagorda Counties were declared disaster areas.

Impact and Damage...
Major impact and resultant damage occurred in Galveston, Harris, Brazoria and Matagorda counties of Texas. All four of these counties received a Presidential Disaster Declaration to help in the relief and recovery efforts. In these four counties total damage exceeded $286 million dollars. Most of this damage was along the coast and around Galveston Bay where high tides and winds destroyed dunes  and personal property. Nearly 100 single family homes were destroyed along the upper Texas coast by the high tides and battering waves. Other damage was a result of inland flooding due to heavy rains mainly in Harris county along White Oak and Buffalo Bayous. 

There were only 3 deaths that can be attributed to Tropical Storm Frances. A father and daughter drowned on Galveston Island while swimming in the surf during the day Monday. The third death occurred on Wednesday when a surfer drowned on the beaches of Surfside in Brazoria county while surfing the large waves.
 
Summary...
Tropical Storm Frances brought home how vulnerable the Texas Coast is to Tropical weather systems even if they do not achieve Hurricane Strength. Since Frances never achieved Hurricane strength the citizens along the upper Texas Coast never realized the damage that could result from #JUST A TROPICAL STORM#. With a long siege of high tides coupled with Tropical Storm Force Winds it was very similar to having a strong Category One Hurricane. The rains that accompanied the storm were fairly normal for a slow moving Tropical Storm but flooding was aggravated by the High Tides that were already in place when the heavy rains began.",26

With tides above 4 feet MLLW for 36 to 48 consecutive hours and winds in excess of 25 mph through the same period led to the destructive waves along the beach front.  These destructive waves resulted in most of the dune systems from High Island to Sargent Texas being almost completely destroyed.

Winds and Pressure..
Winds ranged from 25 to 35 knots (29 - 40 mph) for over 24 hours starting around midnight on the September 10 and continuing til the early morning of September 11. The strongest wind recorded was 47 knots (54 mph) at Galveston Scholes Field around 6pm on Sept. 10. Other peak winds recorded around the area included 46 knots (53 mph) at Palacios and 31 knots (36 mph) at Houston Intercontinental Airport.  at Palacios and 31 knots (36 mph) at Houston Intercontinental Airport.  

The lowest atmospheric pressure recorded was at Palacios when the barometer read 29.38 inches at 254 PM on Sept. 11. Galveston recorded 29.48 inches at 529 am Sept. 11.

Rainfall...
Rainfall from Tropical Storm Frances began effecting the coastal areas during the morning on Thursday and conditions slowly spread inland Thursday afternoon and further inland early Friday morning. Over 4 inches of rain fell over all of the Houston/Galveston County Warning area. Over 10 inches of rain was common along the coastal counties of Matagorda...Brazoria...Galveston and Chambers and also over inland counties including Harris...Polk...San Jacinto and Washington. With tides already running 4 to 6 feet above normal the runoff from the rains was not able to easily runoff into the bays thus resulting in more widespread flooding of inland creeks and bayous especially early Friday morning. 

River and Bayou Flooding...
September was an active month across the HSA with Tropical Storm Frances dumping 4 to 6 inches of rain over the region.  Large areas received 8 to 10 inches of rain with some areas receiving more than 12 inches.  The result was significant flooding in many areas.  Flooding was exacerbated in many areas by tides 4 to 6 feet above normal.  Significant rises occurred on the San Bernard River in Brazoria County from above Sweeny to the mouth on September 9th with flood stage exceeded on September 10th. This rise was mainly  due to strong tidal influence.  Significant rains began on September 10th and continued through the 12th. The majority of the rain occurred during the morning hours of September 11th as Frances made landfall.  

By daybreak September 11th  significant flooding was occurring in Harris County and the City of Houston.  Homes in Jersey Village and Woodland Trails in northwest Houston along White Oak Bayou were flooding by 6:00 am. Most subdivisions along White Oak Bayou experienced house flooding.  Homes were also flooded on Halls Bayou above I-45, on Brays Bayou at Lawndale near the confluence with the Houston Ship Channel, and on Armand Bayou near Spencer Highway in Pasadena.   I-10 between the West Loop and downtown Houston and I-45 near North Main Street were closed by 9:00 am due to flooding from Buffalo and White Oak Bayous.  State Highway 288 was closed due to flooding from Brays Bayou.  In all more than 1400 homes and businesses were damaged or destroyed in this event.

In Brazoria County Chocolate Bayou near Alvin exceeded its banks in the channel above FM 1462 to the mouth at Chocolate Bay.  Several minor roads were impacted by this flooding.

Significant flooding occurred on the San Bernard River above U.S. Highway 59 near Kendalton to the mouth.  Primary flooding above fm 442 near Boling was due to backwater on the tributaries of Peach and West Bernard Creeks in Wharton County.  While no homes were reported flooded several roads in the El Lobo subdivision were inundated.  A combination of strong tidal influence and heavy rain produced the rise in the channel above Sweeny to the mouth.  While low lying areas along the river were flooded the most significant impact was on barge traffic at the Phillips Petroleum Facility.

The Tres Palacios River in Matagorda County began rising at the rate of one foot an hour during the evening hours of September 10th resulting in moderate lowland flooding above State Highway 71 near Midfield to the mouth at Tres Palacios Bay.   Significant backwater up Juanita Creek, about one mile upstream from the gaging station FM 456 was also noted.  Several farm to market and county roads in Matagorda County were inundated by this flood.  There were no reports of homes flooded, however, several areas were isolated due to the flooded roadways.

Flooding on East Mustang Creek near Louise in Wharton County closed FM 647 for several hours on September 12th. Secondary and minor roads near the creek were also inundated. 

Several small, ungaged watersheds in Chambers, Galveston, Brazoria, Matagorda, Fort Bend, and Wharton Counties flooded.  This resulted in the closing of many farm to market and county with several homes and subdivisions threatened.  These included Dickinson Bayou in Galveston County, Oyster Creek in Brazoria County and Caney Creek in Matagorda County.

Water had receded on all but the San Bernard and Tres Palacios Rivers by the afternoon of September 12th.  There were no deaths of serious injuries due to river flooding associated with this event.  Galveston, Harris, Brazoria, and Matagorda Counties were declared disaster areas.

Impact and Damage...
Major impact and resultant damage occurred in Galveston, Harris, Brazoria and Matagorda counties of Texas. All four of these counties received a Presidential Disaster Declaration to help in the relief and recovery efforts. In these four counties total damage exceeded $286 million dollars. Most of this damage was along the coast and around Galveston Bay where high tides and winds destroyed dunes  and personal property. Nearly 100 single family homes were destroyed along the upper Texas coast by the high tides and battering waves. Other damage was a result of inland flooding due to heavy rains mainly in Harris county along White Oak and Buffalo Bayous. 

There were only 3 deaths that can be attributed to Tropical Storm Frances. A father and daughter drowned on Galveston Island while swimming in the surf during the day Monday. The third death occurred on Wednesday when a surfer drowned on the beaches of Surfside in Brazoria county while surfing the large waves.
 
Summary...
Tropical Storm Frances brought home how vulnerable the Texas Coast is to Tropical weather systems even if they do not achieve Hurricane Strength. Since Frances never achieved Hurricane strength the citizens along the upper Texas Coast never realized the damage that could result from #JUST A TROPICAL STORM#. With a long siege of high tides coupled with Tropical Storm Force Winds it was very similar to having a strong Category One Hurricane. The rains that accompanied the storm were fairly normal for a slow moving Tropical Storm but flooding was aggravated by the High Tides that were already in place when the heavy rains began.",29

By daybreak September 11th  significant flooding was occurring in Harris County and the City of Houston.  Homes in Jersey Village and Woodland Trails in northwest Houston along White Oak Bayou were flooding by 6:00 am. Most subdivisions along White Oak Bayou experienced house flooding.  Homes were also flooded on Halls Bayou above I-45, on Brays Bayou at Lawndale near the confluence with the Houston Ship Channel, and on Armand Bayou near Spencer Highway in Pasadena.   I-10 between the West Loop and downtown Houston and I-45 near North Main Street were closed by 9:00 am due to flooding from Buffalo and White Oak Bayous.  State Highway 288 was closed due to flooding from Brays Bayou.  In all more than 1400 homes and businesses were damaged or destroyed in this event.

In Brazoria County Chocolate Bayou near Alvin exceeded its banks in the channel above FM 1462 to the mouth at Chocolate Bay.  Several minor roads were impacted by this flooding.

Significant flooding occurred on the San Bernard River above U.S. Highway 59 near Kendalton to the mouth.  Primary flooding above fm 442 near Boling was due to backwater on the tributaries of Peach and West Bernard Creeks in Wharton County.  While no homes were reported flooded several roads in the El Lobo subdivision were inundated.  A combination of strong tidal influence and heavy rain produced the rise in the channel above Sweeny to the mouth.  While low lying areas along the river were flooded the most significant impact was on barge traffic at the Phillips Petroleum Facility.

The Tres Palacios River in Matagorda County began rising at the rate of one foot an hour during the evening hours of September 10th resulting in moderate lowland flooding above State Highway 71 near Midfield to the mouth at Tres Palacios Bay.   Significant backwater up Juanita Creek, about one mile upstream from the gaging station FM 456 was also noted.  Several farm to market and county roads in Matagorda County were inundated by this flood.  There were no reports of homes flooded, however, several areas were isolated due to the flooded roadways.

Flooding on East Mustang Creek near Louise in Wharton County closed FM 647 for several hours on September 12th. Secondary and minor roads near the creek were also inundated. 

Several small, ungaged watersheds in Chambers, Galveston, Brazoria, Matagorda, Fort Bend, and Wharton Counties flooded.  This resulted in the closing of many farm to market and county with several homes and subdivisions threatened.  These included Dickinson Bayou in Galveston County, Oyster Creek in Brazoria County and Caney Creek in Matagorda County.

Water had receded on all but the San Bernard and Tres Palacios Rivers by the afternoon of September 12th.  There were no deaths of serious injuries due to river flooding associated with this event.  Galveston, Harris, Brazoria, and Matagorda Counties were declared disaster areas.

Impact and Damage...
Major impact and resultant damage occurred in Galveston, Harris, Brazoria and Matagorda counties of Texas. All four of these counties received a Presidential Disaster Declaration to help in the relief and recovery efforts. In these four counties total damage exceeded $286 million dollars. Most of this damage was along the coast and around Galveston Bay where high tides and winds destroyed dunes  and personal property. Nearly 100 single family homes were destroyed along the upper Texas coast by the high tides and battering waves. Other damage was a result of inland flooding due to heavy rains mainly in Harris county along White Oak and Buffalo Bayous. 

There were only 3 deaths that can be attributed to Tropical Storm Frances. A father and daughter drowned on Galveston Island while swimming in the surf during the day Monday. The third death occurred on Wednesday when a surfer drowned on the beaches of Surfside in Brazoria county while surfing the large waves.
 
Summary...
Tropical Storm Frances brought home how vulnerable the Texas Coast is to Tropical weather systems even if they do not achieve Hurricane Strength. Since Frances never achieved Hurricane strength the citizens along the upper Texas Coast never realized the damage that could result from #JUST A TROPICAL STORM#. With a long siege of high tides coupled with Tropical Storm Force Winds it was very similar to having a strong Category One Hurricane. The rains that accompanied the storm were fairly normal for a slow moving Tropical Storm but flooding was aggravated by the High Tides that were already in place when the heavy rains began.",32

On Monday September 7 (Labor Day) a tropical disturbance in the western Gulf of Mexico was increasing the pressure gradient along the Texas coast. A weak cold front had pushed south to near the Red River by Tuesday evening. At 4pm Tuesday the disturbance was upgraded to a Tropical Depression located about 250 miles south of Galveston. On Wednesday morning the cold front had sagged down to a Lufkin to Dallas line with a 1022 high pressure centered over the Ohio Valley. At 4 PM the depression was upgraded to a Tropical Storm and given the name Frances. Winds along the upper Texas coast were from the ENE 20 to 30 mph with gusts nearing 40 mph. The poorly organized Tropical Storm center of circulation was still located about 250 miles south of Galveston with maximum sustained winds of 40 mph. On Thursday the storm remained disorganized and was located about 190 miles south of Galveston. On Thursday afternoon the storm had deepened and maximum sustained winds had increased to near 60 mph. The surface ridge of high pressure had now shifted to the southeast centered over Tennessee increasing the pressure gradient and the winds along the upper Texas coast. Early Friday morning Frances neared the Texas coast near Port O#Connor. Winds along the upper Texas coast continued at 30 to 40 mph sustained winds with gusts near 50 mph at times. Frances moved inland just southwest of Victoria and remained nearly stationary throughout the day on Friday. On Friday evening Frances began moving to the north northeast. At 7 PM Frances was downgraded to a Tropical Depression as it moved to the northeast of Victoria. At 10 PM the remnants of Frances was located about 65 miles west of Houston and it was longer being tracked by the National Hurricane Center.

Tides....
Most of the damage along the coastal communities can be attributed to the high tides that persisted for nearly two days. The high tides in Galveston Bay also enhanced the flooding problems experienced further inland by the heavy rains. A Coastal Flood Watch was issued Monday night concerning the possibility of high tides beginning on Tuesday with tides expected to run 3 feet above predicted levels.  On Tuesday afternoon the Coastal Flood Watch was updated to extend the watch into Wednesday with tides predicted to be 3 to 4 feet above predicted levels by Wednesday afternoon. At 4pm Tuesday Tropical Depression #6 formed in the Gulf of Mexico and a Tropical Storm Warning was issued for the Texas Coast from High Island to Brownsville. The Tropical Storm Warning implies Coastal Flood Warning is also in effect.. On Wednesday the tide forecast was updated with a forecast of tides 4 to 5 feet above predicted levels expected on Thursday. On Thursday the tide prediction for Friday called for tides increasing to levels of 4 to 6 feet above the predicted levels. 

On the beach front at Galveston Pleasure Pier the tides rose above 4 feet above MLLW on Wednesday afternoon (Sept 9) and remained above this level until the Friday afternoon (Sept. 11). The maximum level was reached on Thursday evening when the gauge read around 7 feet above MLLW or about 4.5 feet above the predicted levels. In Galveston Bay a similar even took place. At Eagle Point the tides rose above 4 feet above MLLW on Wednesday evening (October 9) and stayed above this level until after midnight on October 12. The peak height reached was around 5.7 feet above MLLW during the early morning hours of October 10 which is 4.7 feet above the predicted levels. 

Similar conditions were found along the entire upper Texas Coast from High Island to Matagorda and in the inland bays. With tides above 4 feet MLLW for 36 to 48 consecutive hours and winds in excess of 25 mph through the same period led to the destructive waves along the beach front.  These destructive waves resulted in most of the dune systems from High Island to Sargent Texas being almost completely destroyed.

Winds and Pressure..
Winds ranged from 25 to 35 knots (29 - 40 mph) for over 24 hours starting around midnight on the September 10 and continuing til the early morning of September 11. The strongest wind recorded was 47 knots (54 mph) at Galveston Scholes Field around 6pm on Sept. 10. Other peak winds recorded around the area included 46 knots (53 mph) at Palacios and 31 knots (36 mph) at Houston Intercontinental Airport.  at Palacios and 31 knots (36 mph) at Houston Intercontinental Airport.  

The lowest atmospheric pressure recorded was at Palacios when the barometer read 29.38 inches at 254 PM on Sept. 11. Galveston recorded 29.48 inches at 529 am Sept. 11.

Rainfall...
Rainfall from Tropical Storm Frances began effecting the coastal areas during the morning on Thursday and conditions slowly spread inland Thursday afternoon and further inland early Friday morning. Over 4 inches of rain fell over all of the Houston/Galveston County Warning area. Over 10 inches of rain was common along the coastal counties of Matagorda...Brazoria...Galveston and Chambers and also over inland counties including Harris...Polk...San Jacinto and Washington. With tides already running 4 to 6 feet above normal the runoff from the rains was not able to easily runoff into the bays thus resulting in more widespread flooding of inland creeks and bayous especially early Friday morning. 

River and Bayou Flooding...
September was an active month across the HSA with Tropical Storm Frances dumping 4 to 6 inches of rain over the region.  Large areas received 8 to 10 inches of rain with some areas receiving more than 12 inches.  The result was significant flooding in many areas.  Flooding was exacerbated in many areas by tides 4 to 6 feet above normal.  Significant rises occurred on the San Bernard River in Brazoria County from above Sweeny to the mouth on September 9th with flood stage exceeded on September 10th. This rise was mainly  due to strong tidal influence.  Significant rains began on September 10th and continued through the 12th. The majority of the rain occurred during the morning hours of September 11th as Frances made landfall.  

By daybreak September 11th  significant flooding was occurring in Harris County and the City of Houston.

Wind gusts in excess of 50 mph occurred along the coast on September 11th, but most of the damage occurred from the high tides.  At Sabine Pass, the tide reading reached 5.3 ft MSL, which was one of the highest tides in the last 30 years. On top of the high tides, heavy rain lasting several days dropped 8 to 10 inches of rain across the region.

At Sea Rim State Park, water got to the top of the dunes, which is 8 to 9 feet higher than normal.

Offshore oil workers evacuated before 70 to 80 mph wind gusts impacted the rigs offshore. Many of these evacuees landed in Sabine Pass, Texas, and were caught in town due to the high tides.  Sabine Pass was totally isolated from road traffic for three days due to high water. Nearly every home and business in Sabine Pass had salt water enter them (over 70 places).  Highway 87 between Sabine Pass and Port Arthur was closed early in the morning on September 10th, and was not reopened until September 15th.  As much as 3 feet of water covered sections of Highway 87 across Jefferson County.

Allison moved northward, making landfall on the west end of Galveston Island between midnight and 1am on the 6th, less than 12 hours after forming.  As Allison moved inland it caused two to three foot tides, which had little impact on the area.  On the evening of the 5th a tornado briefly touched down in Brazoria county causing damage to one home in the Manvel area.  Over the next five days Allison produced record rainfall that led to devastating flooding across Southeast Texas, killing 22 people and damaging over 48,000 homes, 70,000 automobiles and nearly 2000 businesses.

The first significant flooding occurred while Allison was still offshore.  A large spiral band with very heavy rainfall moved inland from Galveston to the Houston area, and by mid evening 8 to 12 inch totals were common from northern Galveston county into southern Harris county.  Heavy rain continued over inland portions of Southeast Texas overnight with 3 to 5 inch totals common, as Allison moved inland and weakened.

On the morning of June 6th, Allison was downgraded to a tropical depression.  Allison moved north until it was near Lufkin, then made a clockwise loop and began drifting to the southwest.  Before sunrise on June 7th, the center was near Huntsville, and a band of heavy rain moved into Liberty county producing 5 to 10 inches of rain, causing almost a foot of water on Highway 90.  Around the same time another area of thunderstorms developed over the Sugar Land - Stafford areas of Fort Bend and Harris counties, producing another 8 to 12 inches of rain and causing abundant street flooding and water in some homes.  During the day moderate to heavy rain continued over Brazoria, Houston, Liberty, Polk, Trinity and Walker counties resulting in additional reports of flooding.

June 8th began with another 5 to 10 inches of rainfall along the immediate coast, causing flooding in southern Brazoria county, central Galveston county and northern Chambers county.  Skies cleared for a few hours, but the rain began again that afternoon over Montgomery county.  Thunderstorms intensified rapidly over southern Montgomery and eastern Harris counties and began to train across the Houston metro area that evening and into June 9th.  Very heavy rainfall was observed for up to 10 hours in some locations, and rainfall rates of 4 inches or more per hour were observed throughout the night.  Flash flooding initiated quite rapidly during rush hour late Friday afternoon.  Widespread street flooding was the initial threat, but the high rainfall amounts forced almost all the major Houston area bayou systems into severe flooding, with some to record levels.  The flooding caused a complete shutdown of downtown Houston, including all major roadways and both major airports for more than 12 hours.  The Texas Medical Center along Brays Bayou sustained severe damage resulting in the complete shutdown of several hospitals and a significant loss of research data.  Twenty-two people lost their lives due to the flash flooding in Harris county on the 8th and 9th.

On the morning of June 6th, Allison was downgraded to a tropical depression.  Allison moved north until it was near Lufkin, then made a clockwise loop and began drifting to the southwest.  Before sunrise on June 7th, the center was near Huntsville, and a band of heavy rain moved into Liberty county producing 5 to 10 inches of rain, causing almost a foot of water on Highway 90.  Around the same time another area of thunderstorms developed over the Sugar Land - Stafford areas of Fort Bend and Harris counties, producing another 8 to 12 inches of rain and causing abundant street flooding and water in some homes.  During the day moderate to heavy rain continued over Brazoria, Houston, Liberty, Polk, Trinity and Walker counties resulting in additional reports of flooding.

June 8th began with another 5 to 10 inches of rainfall along the immediate coast, causing flooding in southern Brazoria county, central Galveston county and northern Chambers county.  Skies cleared for a few hours, but the rain began again that afternoon over Montgomery county.  Thunderstorms intensified rapidly over southern Montgomery and eastern Harris counties and began to train across the Houston metro area that evening and into June 9th.  Very heavy rainfall was observed for up to 10 hours in some locations, and rainfall rates of 4 inches or more per hour were observed throughout the night.  Flash flooding initiated quite rapidly during rush hour late Friday afternoon.  Widespread street flooding was the initial threat, but the high rainfall amounts forced almost all the major Houston area bayou systems into severe flooding, with some to record levels.  The flooding caused a complete shutdown of downtown Houston, including all major roadways and both major airports for more than 12 hours.  The Texas Medical Center along Brays Bayou sustained severe damage resulting in the complete shutdown of several hospitals and a significant loss of research data.  Twenty-two people lost their lives due to the flash flooding in Harris county on the 8th and 9th.

On June 9th the circulation center of the storm gradually made its way toward Palacios.

On Thursday, September 5th, this disturbance became the sixth tropical depression of the 2002 hurricane season with a poorly defined center located approximately 125 miles southeast of Galveston, Texas.  That evening, just six hours after formation, the depression became Tropical Storm Fay as winds strengthened to 40 mph.

Fay remained nearly stationary Thursday night and through most of Friday.  However, Fay did manage to slowly strengthen with winds reaching 60 mph late Friday morning (September 6th).  On Friday evening, Fay began to redevelop further west near a cluster of strong thunderstorms.  These thunderstorms began pushing inland along the southeast Texas coastline between San Luis Pass and Palacios around 11 PM CDT.  As this cluster of thunderstorms moved inland, it produced extremely heavy rainfall, tornadoes, and strong damaging wind gusts. The center of Fay moved inland early Saturday morning (September 7th) near Palacios and weakened to a tropical depression late that morning.

There were no deaths in Southeast Texas associated with Fay.  Three people were injured when a tornado damaged a mobile home in southern Fort Bend County Friday night.  Fay produced a total of five tornadoes along a path from Freeport in Brazoria County to near Hungerford in Wharton County.  

Flooding was significant in Brazoria, Matagorda and Wharton counties due to high tides and severe rainwater flooding.  Between 10 and 20 inches of rain fell in an area from Freeport north-northwest to Boling in eastern Wharton County.  The hardest hit area was near the community of Sweeny in southwest Brazoria County.  In Brazoria County, over 1500 homes were flooded. Over 800 homes received damage from winds and tornadoes. Nearly 100 businesses and nearly 100 multi-family buildings were damaged.  Nearly 500 cars were flooded.  In Matagorda County, 130 single family homes and 32 businesses were damaged mainly by flood waters.  As a result of high tides and heavy rain, over $1.2 million in damage was done to public facilities including roads, bridges and public buildings.  In Wharton County, over 200 single family homes were damaged or destroyed. Tornadoes damaged 7 homes while the remainder of the damage was due to flooding.

It is estimated that beach erosion from high tides produced $3.5 million in damage to public roads, bridges and recreational areas across Galveston County. Another half a million dollars in damage from the high tides was inflicted on 135 residential structures.  Of these 135 structures, 23 received major damage. 

The highest reported wind gust was in the town of Clute in Brazoria County where an 83 mph wind gust was recorded at 120 AM CDT on Saturday.

The highest recorded tide level occurred at Jamaica Beach where the tide level reached 5.40 feet above mean low-lower water at 830 AM CDT Saturday morning, September 7th.","",57

Prior rainbands had produced frequent gusts to 40 mph, but the arrival of sustained tropical storm winds was soon followed by wind damage and power outages, particularly during the afternoon.  Prior to Dolly's landfall along the Cameron/Willacy County line, the western and southern eyewall intensified.  The core of the eyewall traversed northern Cameron County, where impacts were more substantial than in southern Cameron County.||Northern Cameron (Harlingen, San Benito, Rio Hondo):  A period of estimated and measured sustained winds betwee 60 and 70 mph, with frequent gusts to hurricane force (at least 78 mph measured at 2.25 meters), developed around 1 PM and continue through around 5 PM, beginning in northeast Cameron County near Arroyo City and extending west through Las Yescas, Rio Hondo, Harlingen, San Benito, Palm Valley, and La Feria, not only created widespread freshwater flooding, but created notable damage to poorly fastened roofs and some walls, particularly at industrial parks, strip centers, and farm buildings, especially from Harlingen to points east. Otherwise, numerous large limbs, power lines and power poles, highway signs and billboards, were blown down across the area during this time period.||As Dolly's center eased slowly from southern Willacy into northern Hidalgo County, the last of the sustained tropical storm force winds began to exit Cameron County from Palm Valley to Santa Rosa and La Feria, just after midnight on the 24th.||Southern Cameron: Along and just north of the Rio Grande, from the Kellers Corner/Brownsville Airport area through Brownsville and to points west, roughly along federal highway 281 through Los Indios out toward the Hidalgo/Cameron County line, conditions were a bit more benign, as the core of the southern and western eyewall generally missed the area.  Here, sustained tropical storm force winds persisted from around 830 AM until 6 PM, though gusts above 40 mph persisted until near midnight.  In this area, sustained wind generally peaked between 45 and 55 mph, with peak gusts just below hurricane force between 1130 AM and 2 PM. Here, damage was primarily to thousands of tree limbs, hundreds of power lines, and many elevated highway signs and billboards, but structural damage was primarily to unfastened shingles of roofs of moderate to well constructed buildings, and occasional failures of more poorly constructed roofs at industrial parks and farm buildings. ||At the peak of the storm, power was out to just about all of Cameron County, with an estimated 115,000 customers down during the middle of the afternoon.  Across northern Cameron County, power recovery would take days to more than a week, while many locations in southern Cameron County returned to power within a few days after Dolly's passage.","Hurricane Dolly, the first storm since Bret (1999) to make landfall along the Deep South Texas barrier islands, left a trail of widespread minor to moderate structural and natural damage across much of the Lower Rio Grande Valley and Deep South Texas on July 23rd, and dumped copious rainfall across the area, causing numerous instances of flooding primarily of low lying and poor drainage locations, as well as filling local resacas and arroyos, and causing notable rises on larger area creeks and rivers. Dolly intensified rapidly to an estimated minimum pressure of 962 mb while drifting northward just east of South Padre Island, and its center made landfall between 1 and 2 PM on July 23rd along the unpopulated shoreline of Cameron and Willacy County. Dolly then eased westward across southern Willacy County through the afternoon, continued into extreme northern Hidalgo County as a tropical storm during the evening, then turned northwest and accelerated through Jim Hogg County during the early morning hours of the 24th, passing into Webb County shortly after sunrise.||The strong winds and heavy rains contributed to widespread power outages in the Lower Rio Grande Valley, where at least 236,000 customers lost power, but possibly upwards of 250,000 - primarily across the more populated regions of Cameron, Hidalgo, and Willacy County. Agricultural experts deemed a substantial loss of cotton and sorghum due to the strong winds and torrential rain. As of the end of Calendar Year 2008, estimated insured property damage (wind) based on the standard doubling of insurance estimates from the Property Claims Service of the Insurance Services Office was $1.05 billion.  Reported insured flood damage from FEMA's National Flood Insurance Program is $171 thousand; however, it is estimated that the vast majority of flood damage occurred to uninsured properties, and a rough estimate of total flood damage, which was more widespread, and includes agricultural losses, will likely push total flood-related damages to between $100 and $300 million.  ||It is conceivable that total damage from all Hurricane Dolly related hazards may have exceeded $1.5 billion.||More than 6,000 Lower Rio Grande Valley residents were housed in temporary shelters from Deep South Texas to San Antonio at the peak of the storm; 13,000 residents across the Lower Rio Grande Valley visited FEMA Disaster Recovery Centers after the storm.  As of October 3rd, FEMA had distributed $44 million in relief; $30 million to individual households, nearly $10 million to small businesses through the Small Business Administration, and just under $5 million to local governments for infrastructure repair.||Please note that best estimates will be included on a county by county basis as data is received through the rest of the year.  ||Storm total rainfall from the evening of July 22nd through the early afternoon of July 24th generally ranged from 4 to 10 inches in Kenedy, Brooks, Starr, Jim Hogg, and Zapata Counties, and 6 to 14 inches in  Hidalgo, Willacy, and Cameron Counties, with locally more than 18 inches possible in the persistent southern eyewall in northern Cameron and southern Willacy Counties.  Widespread freshwater flooding occurred in these areas as Dolly moved through, and low lying, poor drainage, or areas where drainage systems failed were flooded for days, and in some cases weeks, to come.||The late intensification of Dolly just prior to landfall, combined with a brief northward jog before turning to the west along the Cameron/Willacy County line, limited Gulf storm surge effects across the Town of South Padre Island through mid morning on the 23rd.  However, hurricane force west winds whipped an estimated 3 to 4 foot water rise from Laguna Madre across the Town, with water briefly stretching across the Island at the height of the event.  The town of Port Mansfield, immediately north of the center, estimated a 4 foot storm surge and 5 foot storm tide. ||Interestingly, tides to the north of Dolly's center initially fell to below predicted values on increasing northerly winds, before rising during the late afternoon and evening as the cyclone moved inland, and strong southerly flow piled a storm tide of up to 6 feet above Mean Lower Low Water (MLLW) along the uninhabited Kenedy County shoreline.||There was a single confirmed tornado in Cameron County during the late evening of July 22nd, associated with one of the first outer rain bands.

The peak wind gust measured in the Corpus Christi county warning area was 63 MPH at the Automated Surface Observing System (ASOS) in Alice, Texas. The winds peaked at approximately 60 mph along the barrier island as well from Bob Hall Pier down to Baffin Bay. The gusty winds caused sporadic power outages across the southern Coastal Bend and Rio Grande Plains, primarily between Corpus Christi and Laredo. In addition, sporatic downed trees occurred throughout the region.  In Corpus Chrisit, part of the roof of the Memorial Coliseum was torn off by the winds.  Two boats, not properly anchored, were also damaged in the Corpus Christi Marina.  In Duval County, the roof of a mobile home and V.F.W. Hall were torn off in San Diego from the wind gusts.  In Benavides, in addition to tree and power line damage, wind gusts damaged part of a high school football stadium press box.||Although the center of Dolly passed well to our south, her slow forward motion before landfall caused water levels to rise along the Mid Texas Coast. A storm surge of 2.5-3.5 feet MSL was observed along the mid Coast and total storm tides 3-4 feet MSL on North Padre Island shortly after the time of landfall Wednesday Evening.  It is also interesting to note that total storm tides peaked at 3-4 feet MSL in the back bays including Nueces Bay and Lavaca Bay.||Isolated tornadoes occurred in the northeast quadrant of Dolly, including one waterspout and three tornadoes in South Texas. Only minor damage was observed. The tornadoes were all rated EF-0, with two occuring in San Paticio County and one in Jim Wells County.||Dolly's slow movement produced torrential rainfall over the mid coast region and Rio Grande Plains.

These heavy rains resulted in flooding of rural low lying roadways including FM 70 near Chapman Ranch in southern Nueces County, FM 628 and 1118 in Kleberg County. Minor street flooding was observed in Jim Wells and Duval Counties. The city of Laredo also experienced street flooding as the center of the circulation passed over the city.

These sustained winds would continue toward midnight, and likely a bit after midnight across the western third of the county as additional squalls moved through.  The persistence of the heavy rains eventually produced widespread inland flooding.||Wind damage reports were typical of tropical storm force winds, including the likelihood of thousands of tree limbs blown down, numerous power lines and a number of power poles down, and minor structural damage to poorly constructed buildings, and mobile trailer type homes.  The heaviest damage was concentrated generally along and east of Federal Highway 281, where near hurricane force gusts occurred.||Power outages were widespread, and it was likely that at least 100,000 customers were without power at the peak of the storm during the late afternoon and evening of the 23rd.  As with other hard hit areas in Cameron and Willacy Counties, power was not recovered in full for days, and in some cases more than a week, after the storm had moved by.","Hurricane Dolly, the first storm since Bret (1999) to make landfall along the Deep South Texas barrier islands, left a trail of widespread minor to moderate structural and natural damage across much of the Lower Rio Grande Valley and Deep South Texas on July 23rd, and dumped copious rainfall across the area, causing numerous instances of flooding primarily of low lying and poor drainage locations, as well as filling local resacas and arroyos, and causing notable rises on larger area creeks and rivers.

The peak sustained wind, 51 mph, was recorded at the National Ocean Service (NOS) station at the southeast tip of Port Isabel; a peak gust of 66 mph was recorded along the higher span of the Queen Isabella Bridge, with 62 mph recorded also at the NOS location and 56 mph on South Padre Island.  The Automated Service Observing System station at Cameron County Airport in Bayview recorded peak sustained winds of 39 mph, with a peak gust of 53 mph at 711 PM CST.  A single peak pulse gust to 51 mph was recorded at this location at 216 AM CST, from a fringe band.  ||No power outage estimates were available, except a quote of 1,441 in the American Electric Power (AEP) service area which includes Port Isabel. Structural damage was not significant from the tropical storm force winds alone.","Feeder bands from intensifying Hurricane Alex produced a prolonged period of locally heavy rain, gusty winds, and a few tornadoes during the day and evening of June 30th.  The center of Alex drifted north-northwest from early evening on the 29th until mid morning of the 30th, reaching a point a little more than 100 miles southeast of Brownsville before accelerating westward into the state of Tamaulipas, Mexico, during the late afternoon and evening.  While accelerating, Alex rapidly gained strength as the inner eyewall tightened; at landfall around 8 PM CST on June 30th, Alex had reached 109 mph, just shy of Category 3 (111 mph) strength with a central pressure of 946 mb.||Steady, locally torrential rains added up to roughly 6 to 9 inches for the entire episode across the Lower Rio Grande Valley, and 4 to 6 inches elsewhere.  Some locations may have received nearly 10 inches of rain.  Three tornadoes were spotted during the morning of June 30th, including two causing notable damage in Cameron County.  Sustained tropical storm force winds were limited to Cameron, Willacy, and coastal Kenedy Counties, though gusts to tropical storm force (39 mph or greater) occurred in central and eastern Hidalgo County, covering the more populated Lower Rio Grande Valley.  ||Wind damage was minor, at best, outside of locations where tornadoes touched down - and concentrated mainly along and near the coastline.  The lack of persistent strong winds minimized power outages, with an estimated 9,000 customers without power across the Rio Grande Valley at the peak of the storm, 8,000 in Cameron County alone.  Though property damage was minimal throughout the Lower Rio Grande Valley, nearly $10 million in sorghum grain damage alone was reported in Hidalgo County, a consequence not only of the rainfall but the timing of the rain during a critical growing period.||The heavy rains flooded many poor drainage locations across the Lower Valley, but nowhere near the impact Hurricane Dolly had in 2008, when a band of 12 to 18 inches fell from Laguna Vista through Harlingen toward Raymondville and into eastern Hidalgo County - falling on top of wet soils from previous rains in early July of that year.  For Alex, modestly dry conditions through June allowed some of the rains to soak into the ground, reducing the impact of urban and flash flooding during and soon after the event ended.||Significantly worse conditions were noted across the border in Matamoros and Reynosa, Tamaulipas, Mexico.  Local rainfall estimates of 10 inches or more combined with poor drainage conditions flooded out six colonias in Matamoros, caused widespread urban type flooding to 400 neighborhoods (80% of the city) and caused significant travel issues.  4,000 residents sought shelter from the floods. In Reynosa, immediately across the border from the City of Hidalgo and Pharr in Hidalgo County, 80 colonias flooded and 15 trees were uprooted, and another seven neighborhoods flooded in nearby Rio Bravo.   ||Substantially worse conditions were seen in Monterrey, Nuevo Leon, where torrential rains in the area and along the Sierra Madre Oriental foothills, creating record flows and life-taking flash flooding along the normally dry Santa Catarina River, which set a record flow of 2500 cubic meters per second (cms), or 88,000 cubic feet per second.  Estimated rainfall of more than 16 inches fell toward the mountains in a short period of time.  Damage was estimated at more than $1.35 billion (USD) as of August 5th.||Incredible rains, perhaps 50 to 70 inches, fell along the east facing slopes of the Sierra Madre in Nuevo Leon and Coahuila State with Alex, and Tropical Depression Number 2 to follow a week later.

The center of the storm made a loop through Gonzales, Karnes, and DeWitt Counties before exiting our County Warning Area during the afternoon of August 27th moving into Victoria County. The maximum sustained winds were 46 mph recorded at Austin Bergstrom International Airport and at two private weather stations, one near Yorktown and the other near Smiley. The maximum recorded wind gusts were 58 mph at New Braunfels Airport, Randolph AFB, and at a private weather station near Smiley. The highest rainfall total was 29.19 inches outside of LaGrange in Fayette County. A number of places in Fayette, Lavaca, and Bastrop Counties received 20 or more inches of rain. Tropical storm force winds with estimated gusts up to 60 mph caused damage across the region. Trees and branches were knocked down by the winds. Some of these in turn knocked down power lines causing power outages in Bastrop, Comal, Hays, and Guadalupe Counties. At one point, 15,000 customers in Comal County were without power. There was also some minor structural damage in Caldwell, Comal, and Lavaca Counties. Maximum rainfall totals in these counties ranged from 4.67 inches in Bexar to 29.19 in Fayette. Flooding and flash flooding forced 608 people to be evacuated from their homes. Most of these, 400, were in Fayette County.",210

Strongest winds occurred during the evening of July 25th, when the southern and eastern eyewall clipped the region along and north of Interstate 2 between Harlingen/Rio Hondo and La Feria north to the Willacy County line.  Measured and estimated wind gusts in these areas were near hurricane force (65 mph) with sustained winds peaking between 40 and 50 mph.  Harlingen/Rio Grande Valley International Airport reported a peak gust to 63 mph before taking a power loss. ||The slow movement of the inner core of Hanna allowed minor wind damage to occur in this area, with at least one hundred trees losing large limbs along with power lines and several power poles snapped or bent. Minor damage also occurred to poorly built structures along the IH-2 corridor as well as along the IH-69E corridor from Harlingen/San Benito northward.  This included a number of fences blown down and a roof blown off a shed near La Feria. At the storm's peak, an estimated 50 thousand electric customers were without power.  Total dollar damage estimates were not available as of this writing, but will likely be well into the tens of millions of dollars. Public Assistance dollar values were estimated to be $1.88 million.||Crop damage was also significant, with sugar cane snapped in many fields and young fruit being blown off citrus trees, which also sustained damage.  Estimated dollar value loss based on reports from Texas Agrilife in late summer was $25.9 million in Cameron County.","Hurricane Hanna, the 2020 Atlantic season's first Hurricane, made landfall along the unpopulated Padre Island National Seashore on the mid-Kenedy County coastline as a Category 1 storm at around 5 PM Central Time Saturday, July 25th, carrying sustained 90 mph winds with gusts over 100 mph in a small portion of the inner eye wall. The hurricane spun slowly but steadily into southern Kenedy and northern Hidalgo County through just after midnight on the 26th, then through Starr County as a Tropical Storm before moving into Tamaulipas before daybreak and eventually near Monterrey, Nuevo Leon, by noon before dissipating during the evening of the 26th. Following the passage of the inner eye wall, broad feeder bands of torrential rains and gusty tropical storm force winds continued through the mid to late morning hours of July 26th, slowly migrating from east to west across the populated Rio Grande Valley. ||Other than storm surge flooding, which peaked just north of Baffin Bay on the Kleberg and Nueces County coast near Corpus Christi, Hanna's memory for the Rio Grande Valley will be flooding rainfall, power outages, and an array of damage to poorly constructed buildings, from minor roof damage to complete demolition.
