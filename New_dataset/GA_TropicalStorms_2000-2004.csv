Spiral bands of heavy rain and some thunderstorms began affecting east central and middle Georgia during the afternoon of the 11'th, with additional development of heavy rain on the 12'th and 13'th, especially in eastern areas. The heaviest rain fell from the evening of the 12'th through the early morning hours of the 13'th in an area generally bounded by Athens, Eatonton, Milledgeville, Crawfordville, and Lexington. In these areas, 24 rainfall amounts of 5 to 8 inches were common, with 10 inches observed in 24 hours on the Little River five miles southeast of Washington in Wilkes county.  Two to three day rainfall totals exceeded 10 inches in several places in this area.  The Little River crested at 28.4 feet, exceeding the previous highest stage ever recorded of 26.4 feet.  Flooding was also observed on the Oconee River at Milledgeville with a crest of 33.7, two feet above flood stage.  Several counties were significantly impacted by the flooding rainfall with many roads and bridges being washed out. Greene county was one of the hardest hit where a bridge was washed out leaving 25 residents of the Lake Oconee Point Royal neighborhood stranded.  These residents had to be ferried by Sheriff patrol boat to their homes.  Over 20 roads were under water in Greene county alone.  Putnam, Baldwin, and Taliaferro counties were also hard hit with numerous secondary roads and even some state highways flooded.  Several secondary roads had to be closed, a few of which were even washed out.  In Pulaski county, a road in the southwest part of the county was washed out leaving a 10 foot canyon where the road used to be.  In Milledgeville, an Animal Hospital had to be evacuated when a nearby creek rising out of its banks threatened to flood the facility.
