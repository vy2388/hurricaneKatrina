Hurricane Bertha made landfall near Wilmington North Carolina close to 5 p.m. EDT on the 12th and moved northnortheast overnight.  At 11 p.m. EDT it was 100 miles southwest of Norfolk, at 3 a.m. EDT on the 13th it was 45 miles westsouthwest of Norfolk, at 8 a.m. EDT it was 45 miles south of Dover, at 930 a.m. EDT it was in extreme northeastern Sussex County and at 11 a.m. EDT it was near Atlantic City.

While the long trip over land did weakened Bertha, some wind related damage did occur in Sussex and Kent Counties.  The only tidal flooding was minor and occurred on Delaware State Route 54 near Fenwick Island, one of the most flood roads in the state.  Beach erosion was minor.  The tropical storm did drop between 1.5 and 3.0 inches of rain across most of the state, with locally higher amounts of around 4 inches reported by SKYWARN Spotters in Sussex County.  This caused some poor drainage flooding, but the only river to flood was the Christina in New Castle County.  Wind gusts reached 58 mph in Dover and 55 mph in Lewes.  The strongest winds occurred between 4 a.m. and 10 a.m. EDT. Power was lost for up to 8 hours by 3,200 homes in the state; most were restored by noon EDT. 

Even two days before Bertha arrived rough surf resulted in 40 water rescues at Bethany Beach on the 11th.  Seashore state campgrounds were closed and shelters were set up, but less than 100 persons used them.  In Bethany Beach, a few poles were snapped and tree limbs came down.  A Subway sign was blown away in Seaside Village.  

Elsewhere, there was minor wind damage reported in Kent and Sussex Counties with storage sheds suffering the most harm.  Many were thrown around.  Some of the worst wind related damage occurred in northwestern parts of Kent County around Clayton and Blackiston.  In Clayton, downed trees blocked three roads.  The roof was blown off one house and the porch roof was blown off another.  Several poles were also knocked down.  Flying debris caused damage to several other garages, homes and porches.

At one time in its life cycle, it was a powerful Category 5 hurricane when it was north of the Leewood Islands. Isabel's track took it west of Chesapeake Bay and was able to funnel water into the bay. This caused flooding along coastal areas all the way into New Castle County. Rivers and streams in New Castle County flooded from two fronts: from the heavy rain inland and also from the storm surge. The tide at Reedy Point reached 8.66 feet above mean lower low water at 506 a.m. EDT on the 19th. The surge was about 5 feet. The surge funneled up the bay and was lower and occurred earlier close to the coast. The highest tide at Lewes (Sussex County) was 6.51 feet above mean lower low water at 324 p.m. EDT on the 18th. The heavy rain did not coincide with the tidal flooding and occurred mainly from the afternoon of the 18th into the early morning of the 19th. Nevertheless, runoff from streams in New Castle County were slowed because of the incoming storm surge. While tides barely reached minor tidal levels along the ocean, the wave action on top of the tide caused beach erosion. Dunes were breached on the ocean front south of South Bethany and water overwashed onto Delaware State Route 1 in several locations. Winds gusted up to 70 mph and caused numerous trees, tree limbs and power lines to be knocked down. This was one of the worst power outage events in history for Conectiv Energy.
