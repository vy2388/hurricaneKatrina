As the hurricane approached the mouth of the Mississippi River on September 27 it slowly turned toward the north making landfall along the Mississippi Coast east of Biloxi, MS around 0400 CST on September 28. The Louisiana coast remained on the relatively weaker west side of the Hurricane Georges' circulation.

Most of southeast Louisiana experienced sustained wind of 40 to 45 mph and gusts to 55 to 65 mph, with the strongest winds reported in lower Plaquemines and far east St. Bernard Parishes.  Most of the wind damage was confined to trees, power lines, house roofs, and a few mobile homes. At the height of the hurricane, 160,000 homes and businesses were without electrical power in southeast Louisiana. Storm surge flooding of 4 to 8 feet was confined to areas outside of the hurricane protection system. Along the Mississippi River, the hurricane storm surge created a 6 to 7 ft rise in the river in Plaquemines Parish and a 5 to 6 ft rise in the river in the New Orleans area late on September 27. Rainfall during the hurricane event was minimal, less than 2 inches, as the area was situated on the drier western semicircle of the hurricane's circulation.  In Louisiana, insured losses from Hurricane George was estimated at $15 million according to insurance industry sources. When non-insured and public losses are considered, total damages in the state likely  totaled near $30 million.  

Large scale evacuations took place on September 25 and September 26 across southeast Louisiana. Based on post hurricane evacuation surveys in Orleans and Jefferson Parish, approximately 500,000   were estimated to have left southeast Louisiana prior to the hurricane. Approximately 31,000 people sought refuge in public shelters throughout Louisiana. Several indirect fatalities occurred when two elderly persons died in the hurricane evacuation enroute to a special needs shelter in Baton Rouge.

Information on parishes experiencing the most damage are listed below:

Jefferson Parish: Affects in the parish were mostly confined to minor wind damage to trees and house roofs, and loss of electrical power due to downed power lines. A maximum wind gust of 55 mph was recorded at New Orleans International Airport at 0411CST on September 28 before power was lost to the wind instrument. Storm surge flooding occurred outside of the hurricane protection levees along Lake Pontchartrain, causing flooding of undeveloped areas. Approximately 3900 people sought refuge in public shelters in the parish.

Orleans Parish: The main affect to Orleans Parish was storm surge flooding outside of the hurricane protection levees, and wind damage to trees and resultant downing of power lines. A storm surge of 4 to 5 feet occurred in far east Orleans Parish causing water flooding of roadways and some damage to fishing camps and houses in the Lake Catherine, Irish Bayou, and Venetian Isles areas.

As the hurricane approached the mouth of the Mississippi River on September 27 it slowly turned toward the north making landfall along the Mississippi Coast east of Biloxi, MS around 0400 CST on September 28. The Louisiana coast remained on the relatively weaker west side of the Hurricane Georges' circulation.

Most of southeast Louisiana experienced sustained wind of 40 to 45 mph and gusts to 55 to 65 mph, with the strongest winds reported in lower Plaquemines and far east St. Bernard Parishes.  Most of the wind damage was confined to trees, power lines, house roofs, and a few mobile homes. At the height of the hurricane, 160,000 homes and businesses were without electrical power in southeast Louisiana. Storm surge flooding of 4 to 8 feet was confined to areas outside of the hurricane protection system. Along the Mississippi River, the hurricane storm surge created a 6 to 7 ft rise in the river in Plaquemines Parish and a 5 to 6 ft rise in the river in the New Orleans area late on September 27. Rainfall during the hurricane event was minimal, less than 2 inches, as the area was situated on the drier western semicircle of the hurricane's circulation.  In Louisiana, insured losses from Hurricane George was estimated at $15 million according to insurance industry sources. When non-insured and public losses are considered, total damages in the state likely  totaled near $30 million.  

Large scale evacuations took place on September 25 and September 26 across southeast Louisiana. Based on post hurricane evacuation surveys in Orleans and Jefferson Parish, approximately 500,000   were estimated to have left southeast Louisiana prior to the hurricane. Approximately 31,000 people sought refuge in public shelters throughout Louisiana. Several indirect fatalities occurred when two elderly persons died in the hurricane evacuation enroute to a special needs shelter in Baton Rouge.

As the hurricane approached the mouth of the Mississippi River on September 27 it slowly turned toward the north making landfall along the Mississippi Coast east of Biloxi, MS around 0400 CST on September 28. The Louisiana coast remained on the relatively weaker west side of the Hurricane Georges' circulation.

Most of southeast Louisiana experienced sustained wind of 40 to 45 mph and gusts to 55 to 65 mph, with the strongest winds reported in lower Plaquemines and far east St. Bernard Parishes.  Most of the wind damage was confined to trees, power lines, house roofs, and a few mobile homes. At the height of the hurricane, 160,000 homes and businesses were without electrical power in southeast Louisiana. Storm surge flooding of 4 to 8 feet was confined to areas outside of the hurricane protection system. Along the Mississippi River, the hurricane storm surge created a 6 to 7 ft rise in the river in Plaquemines Parish and a 5 to 6 ft rise in the river in the New Orleans area late on September 27. Rainfall during the hurricane event was minimal, less than 2 inches, as the area was situated on the drier western semicircle of the hurricane's circulation.  In Louisiana, insured losses from Hurricane George was estimated at $15 million according to insurance industry sources. When non-insured and public losses are considered, total damages in the state likely  totaled near $30 million.  

Large scale evacuations took place on September 25 and September 26 across southeast Louisiana. Based on post hurricane evacuation surveys in Orleans and Jefferson Parish, approximately 500,000   were estimated to have left southeast Louisiana prior to the hurricane. Approximately 31,000 people sought refuge in public shelters throughout Louisiana. Several indirect fatalities occurred when two elderly persons died in the hurricane evacuation enroute to a special needs shelter in Baton Rouge.

As the hurricane approached the mouth of the Mississippi River on September 27 it slowly turned toward the north making landfall along the Mississippi Coast east of Biloxi, MS around 0400 CST on September 28. The Louisiana coast remained on the relatively weaker west side of the Hurricane Georges' circulation.

Most of southeast Louisiana experienced sustained wind of 40 to 45 mph and gusts to 55 to 65 mph, with the strongest winds reported in lower Plaquemines and far east St. Bernard Parishes.  Most of the wind damage was confined to trees, power lines, house roofs, and a few mobile homes. At the height of the hurricane, 160,000 homes and businesses were without electrical power in southeast Louisiana. Storm surge flooding of 4 to 8 feet was confined to areas outside of the hurricane protection system. Along the Mississippi River, the hurricane storm surge created a 6 to 7 ft rise in the river in Plaquemines Parish and a 5 to 6 ft rise in the river in the New Orleans area late on September 27. Rainfall during the hurricane event was minimal, less than 2 inches, as the area was situated on the drier western semicircle of the hurricane's circulation.  In Louisiana, insured losses from Hurricane George was estimated at $15 million according to insurance industry sources. When non-insured and public losses are considered, total damages in the state likely  totaled near $30 million.  

Large scale evacuations took place on September 25 and September 26 across southeast Louisiana. Based on post hurricane evacuation surveys in Orleans and Jefferson Parish, approximately 500,000   were estimated to have left southeast Louisiana prior to the hurricane. Approximately 31,000 people sought refuge in public shelters throughout Louisiana. Several indirect fatalities occurred when two elderly persons died in the hurricane evacuation enroute to a special needs shelter in Baton Rouge.

Information on parishes experiencing the most damage are listed below:

Jefferson Parish: Affects in the parish were mostly confined to minor wind damage to trees and house roofs, and loss of electrical power due to downed power lines. A maximum wind gust of 55 mph was recorded at New Orleans International Airport at 0411CST on September 28 before power was lost to the wind instrument. Storm surge flooding occurred outside of the hurricane protection levees along Lake Pontchartrain, causing flooding of undeveloped areas. Approximately 3900 people sought refuge in public shelters in the parish.

Orleans Parish: The main affect to Orleans Parish was storm surge flooding outside of the hurricane protection levees, and wind damage to trees and resultant downing of power lines. A storm surge of 4 to 5 feet occurred in far east Orleans Parish causing water flooding of roadways and some damage to fishing camps and houses in the Lake Catherine, Irish Bayou, and Venetian Isles areas. A maximum stage of 5.81 ft was recorded at the Rigolets. Along the southwest shore of Lake Pontchartrain, about 85 out of 110 fishing camps built on wooden pilings were destroyed by storm surge and wind driven waves. Some of the camps were more than 75 years old. In the vicinity of West End Park, several restaurants were heavily damaged by storm surge and wind driven waves. A tide gage at West End Marina recorded a stage of 5.8 ft while the gage on the Industrial Canal reached 7.3 ft.

Wind damage occurred to trees and power lines, and also to some house roofs. A wind gust of 55 kt was  recorded at New Orleans Lakefront Airport at 411CST on September 28 before power failed. On Lake Pontchartrain, automated wind sensors on the middle of Lake Pontchartrain Causeway recorded a gust of  68 mph at 720CST on September 28.  At the height of the strong winds late on the September 27 and September 28, over 80,000 houses and businesses were without electrical powers.

Approximately 20,000 people sought refuge in public shelters, with 14,000 of those sheltered in  the Louisiana Superdome.     
 
One in-direct fatality occurred on September 27 when a house fire killed a 40 year old man. The fire was ignited when a candle being used for emergency lighting was knocked over. 

Plaquemine Parish: The lower portion of Plaquemine Parish received the greatest impact from Hurricane George with hurricane force wind gusts experienced late on September 27. An automated NOAA weather station at the Southwest Pass of the Mississippi River recorded a maximum wind gust of 82 mph at 1653CST on September 27.  A storm surge of  7 to 8 feet was experienced along the east bank areas of the parish. A USGS tide gage in Gardene Bay east of Point a la Hache recorded a stage of 8.9 ft before power failed. Considerable storm surge flooding was recorded outside of the hurricane protection levees. About 50 homes and businesses outside of the levee system in the vicinity of Venice were reported to have flooded. Some wind damage to roofs, signs, and mobile homes also occurred within the levee protection system of southern Plaquemine Parish.  Power outages were widespread throughout the parish from the afternoon of September 27 through September 28.  Approximately 15,000 people in the southern portion of the parish evacuated with approximately 2300 people housed in public shelters in the northern portion of the parish.

The hurricane continued to moved north northwest across south central Louisiana before turning northeast across the northern portion of the state.  Due to the rapid weakening, no sustained hurricane force winds were measured in southeast Louisiana.  However, storm surge was significant across the southeast Louisiana coastal areas and tidal lakes. Storm surge tides were 3 to 5 feet above normal across much of coastal southeast Louisiana except 4 to 7 feet above normal across south Lafourche and Terrebonne Parishes, closer to the location where the hurricane made landfall. 

Storm surge caused the most damage in Terrebonne Parish where many communities situated along bayous in the southern portion of the parish received considerable flooding. Storm surge also overtopped or breached several locally built drainage levees during the morning hours of October 4th. Particularly hard hit was the community of Montegut where many homes were flooded several feet deep. Over a thousand homes and businesses in Terrebonne Parish sustained some type of water damage due to storm surge. 

Storm surge flooding was also reported in southern Lafourche Parish where areas outside of the Larose-Golden Meadow were inundated by storm surge flooding.  Grand Isle also was hit with considerable storm surge and beach erosion. 

Considerable flooding of roadways and low lying structures was reported in many areas in coastal southeast Louisiana outside of the hurricane protection levees. Along Lake Pontchartrain and Maurepas, low lying roadways and structures were also flooded, many having been flooded a week earlier due to Tropical Storm Isidore.

The dying system eventually tracked across the Mississippi Delta in the subsequent overnight hours.  Thunderstorm bands, strong winds, and associated tornadoes created damage across northeastern Louisiana during the afternoon and evening hours on the third.  Most of the damage in northeastern Louisiana was in the form of (or caused by) downed trees.  Wind gusts in this area of Louisiana remained below hurricane strength.  However, saturated ground conditions from the combined rainfall of Lili and Isidore (which moved over the same area a week earlier) allowed winds to push down numerous trees.

Hurricane force winds affected the lower portion of Plaquemines Parish. The highest sustained wind recorded in southeast Louisiana was at the NOAA automated weather station at the Southwest Pass of the Mississippi River with sustained winds of 72 knots (83 mph) and gusts to 87 knot (100 mph)  The weather instruments are located at approximately 100 ft above the sea surface. Wind gusts of around 60 knot (69 mph) were recorded at an automated weather station along the coast near Point a-la Hache. Outside of the lower Plaquemines Parish area,  tropical storm force winds were recorded from coastal Terrebonne Parish northeast through the New Orleans area to eastern St. Tammany Parish. The lowest barometric pressure recorded was 983.6 mb at the Southwest Pass automated weather station.  

Lower portions of Plaquemines Parish suffered the greatest wind damage. Several school buildings suffered roof damage as well as several public government buildings. Around 100 mobile homes had some type of wind damage, with approximately 30 mobile homes having major damage or were destroyed. Seven houses suffered major wind damage. 50 power poles were also downed by high winds. In lower St. Bernard parish about a dozen houses had some type of wind damage. In other areas of southeast Louisiana, generally only minor wind damage was reported with power outages. At least 55, 000 customers of the local electric power company experience power outages.

The highest storm surge was confined mostly to areas east of the Mississippi River where storm surge averaged 3 to 5 feet above normal except locally higher in some inlets. The highest storm surge reading was 7.6 feet NGVD at Bayou Dupre in St. Bernard Parish. The storm surge flooded low lying property and roadways outside of the hurricane protection levees in Orleans, St. Bernard and Plaquemines Parishes.  Around Lake Pontchartrain and west of the Mississippi River, storm surge was 2 to 4 feet above normal.
 
No tornadoes were reported in southeast Louisiana and storm total rainfall was fairly light. The greatest storm rainfall total was 2.5 inches at Buras in Plaquemine Parish.

Due to the threat posed by the powerful hurricane, many area residents evacuated the New Orleans metropolitan area at the urging of local emergency management officials. State Police estimated that approximately 600,000 people evacuated from southeast Louisiana including the the New Orleans metro area prior to the hurricane. Another 400,000 other coastal residents from Florida, Alabama and Mississippi moved through the area as they evacuated to the west, away from the expected landfall of hurricane Ivan. In an area west of Kenner, eastbound lanes of Interstate Highway 10 were reversed to handle west bound traffic. Traffic jams developed during the evacuation process due to the large number of evacuees. 

There were no direct fatalities related to Hurricane Ivan, however four elderly residents of southeast Louisiana died during the large scale evacuation in southeast Louisiana. 

The Louisiana Dept of Insurance estimated that insured property damage was approximately $7.9 million.  In a manner utilized by the National Hurricane Center for estimating storm damage, the insured damage estimate was doubled to arrive at total dollar damage of $15.8 million.

Hurricane force winds affected the lower portion of Plaquemines Parish. The highest sustained wind recorded in southeast Louisiana was at the NOAA automated weather station at the Southwest Pass of the Mississippi River with sustained winds of 72 knots (83 mph) and gusts to 87 knot (100 mph)  The weather instruments are located at approximately 100 ft above the sea surface. Wind gusts of around 60 knot (69 mph) were recorded at an automated weather station along the coast near Point a-la Hache. Outside of the lower Plaquemines Parish area,  tropical storm force winds were recorded from coastal Terrebonne Parish northeast through the New Orleans area to eastern St. Tammany Parish. The lowest barometric pressure recorded was 983.6 mb at the Southwest Pass automated weather station.  

Lower portions of Plaquemines Parish suffered the greatest wind damage. Several school buildings suffered roof damage as well as several public government buildings. Around 100 mobile homes had some type of wind damage, with approximately 30 mobile homes having major damage or were destroyed. Seven houses suffered major wind damage. 50 power poles were also downed by high winds. In lower St. Bernard parish about a dozen houses had some type of wind damage. In other areas of southeast Louisiana, generally only minor wind damage was reported with power outages. At least 55, 000 customers of the local electric power company experience power outages.

The highest storm surge was confined mostly to areas east of the Mississippi River where storm surge averaged 3 to 5 feet above normal except locally higher in some inlets. The highest storm surge reading was 7.6 feet NGVD at Bayou Dupre in St. Bernard Parish. The storm surge flooded low lying property and roadways outside of the hurricane protection levees in Orleans, St. Bernard and Plaquemines Parishes.  Around Lake Pontchartrain and west of the Mississippi River, storm surge was 2 to 4 feet above normal.
 
No tornadoes were reported in southeast Louisiana and storm total rainfall was fairly light. The greatest storm rainfall total was 2.5 inches at Buras in Plaquemine Parish.

Due to the threat posed by the powerful hurricane, many area residents evacuated the New Orleans metropolitan area at the urging of local emergency management officials.

Cindy initially was classified as a tropical storm, but was later upgraded to a minimal hurricane based primarily on doppler radar wind estimates of a small area of hurricane force winds just east of the path of the hurricane in the coastal waters and extreme southeast coastal sections.  Most of southeast Louisiana, including the metro New Orleans area experience long duration of tropical storm force winds and high gusts that resulted in considerable wind damage to trees and foliage as well as widespread power outages due to downed electrical lines.  An estimated 278,000 electrical customers experienced power outages. Tropical storm force winds were recorded at the New Orleans Lakefront for five and a half hours starting around 11 pm CDT on July 5th with gusts greater than 55 mph recorded each hour during this period. The maximum sustained wind at the Lakefront Airport was 54 mph, or 47 knots, at 300 AM CDT on July 6th.  A peak gust of 70 mph, or 61 knots,  was recorded at the airport at 116 am CDT on July 6th.  This was the highest wind gust measured during the storm over land areas with the exception of 74 mph, or 64 knots, along the coast at the elevated Burwood CMAN station at 149 am CDT on July 6th.  A gust to 69 mph, or 60 knots, was also recorded at the NOAA C-Man station at Grand Isle. The maximum sustained wind recorded in southeast Louisiana was 55 mph, or 48 knots, at the NOAA C-Man station in Grand Isle. Heavy rainfall resulted in extensive street flooding with rainfall generally amounts ranging from 3 to a little over 6 inches across much of extreme southeast Louisiana.  The lowest pressure measured in southeast Louisiana were 997.3 mb at the NOAA C-Man station in Grand Isle and also at the LSU Citrus Agricultural Station near Port Sulphur.  High tides caused storm surge flooding and beach erosion at Grand Isle.  The highest storm surge recorded was 5.5 feet NGVD at Bayou Dupree near Lake Borgne.

Overall Hurricane Cindy caused approximately $50 million in damage in southeast Louisiana; with $2.5 million from storm surge and the remainder from wind damage. The damage estimate was based on damage estimates from Tropical Storm Bill which took a similar track but was a weaker tropical cyclone. No injuries or fatalities were reported.",96

It will likely be recorded as one the worst natural disaster in the history of the United States to date resulting in catastrophic damage and numerous casualties in southeast Louisiana and along the Mississippi coast.  Damage and casualties resulting from Hurricane Katrina extended as far east as Alabama and the panhandle of Florida.  Katrina developed from a tropical depression southeast of the Bahamas on August 24th.  After moving through the Bahamas as a tropical storm, Katrina strengthened to a category 1 hurricane prior to landfall in south Florida around the Miami area on the 25th of August.  Katrina crossed south Florida and entered the Gulf of Mexico and began to strengthen.  Hurricane Katrina strengthened to a category 5 storm on August 28th about 250 miles south southeast of the mouth of the Mississippi River with winds reaching their peak intensity of 175 mph and a central pressure of 902 mb.  Post event analysis by the National Hurricane Center indicates that Katrina weakened slightly before making landfall as a strong category 3 storm in initial landfall in lower Plaquemines Parish. Maximum sustained winds were estimated at 110 knots or 127 mph and a central pressure of 920 mb around 610 AM CDT on August 29th in southeast Louisiana just south of Buras in Plaquemines Parish.  The storm continued on a north northeast track with the center passing about 40 miles southeast of New Orleans with a second landfall occurring near the Louisiana and Mississippi border around 945 AM CDT as a Category 3 hurricane on the Saffir Simpson scale with maximum sustained winds estimated around 105 knots or 121 mph.  Katrina continued to weaken as it moved north northeast across Mississippi during the day, but remained at hurricane strength 100 miles inland near Laurel, Mississippi.  Katrina weakened to a tropical depression near Clarksville, Tennessee on August 30th.

Damage in southeast Louisiana, especially in the New Orleans area and the coastal parishes, was catastrophic.  Hurricane protection levees and floodwalls were overtopped and/or  breached resulting in widespread and deep flooding of homes and businesses.  Much of Orleans and Plaquemines Parishes and nearly all of St. Bernard Parish were flooded by storm surge. Approximately 80 percent of the city of New Orleans was flooded.  Thousands of people were stranded by the flood waters in homes and buildings and on rooftops for several days and had to be rescued by boat and helicopter. In Jefferson Parish, levees were not compromised, however many homes were flooded by either heavy rain overwhelming limited pumping capacity or storm surge water moving through in-operable pumps into the parish.  Severe storm surge damage also occurred along the north shore of Lake Pontchartrain from Mandeville to Slidell with storm surge water moving inland as far as Old Towne Slidell with water up to 6 feet deep in some locations. Hurricane force winds also caused damage to roofs, power lines, and downed trees. Windows were broken in large buildings in the metro New Orleans area from wind and wind driven debris. In areas away from storm surge flooding, wind damage was widespread with fallen trees taking a heavy toll on houses and power lines, especially over St. Tammany and Washington Parishes.  Excluding losses covered by the Federal Flood Insurance Program, insured property losses in Louisiana were estimated at 22.6 billion dollars. Overall uninsured and insured losses combined were estimated to exceed 100 billion dollars along the entire Gulf Coast.

Fatalities occurring in Louisiana as a result of Hurricane Katrina numbered approximately 1097 people as of late June 2006. The majority of the victims were in the New Orleans area. 480 other Louisiana residents died in other states after evacuating..
 Detailed information on the deaths, locations, and indirect or direct fatalities will be described in updates to Storm Data. 

Due to the failure of power and equipment prior to the peak of the storm, data for wind, storm surge, pressure, and rainfall are incomplete.  A university portable weather unit measured the lowest pressure of 920.2 mb near Buras around 0616 AM AM CDT on Aug 29th. with 934 mb being measured at the National Weather Service Office in Slidell at 938 AM CDT. 

The highest wind gust recorded in Louisiana and the adjacent coastal waters was 99 knots (114 mph) at the Grand Isle CMAN station (338 AM CDT on August 29th) before the gage failed, though higher wind gusts certainly occurred. While most of the metro New Orleans escaped the extreme winds, the extreme eastern portions of the metro area from St Bernard Parish into extreme east New Orleans experienced the western portion of the hurricane eyewall. Wind gusts between 120 to 125 mph were recorded at a couple of locations in East New Orleans. Wind gust to hurricane force (64 kt or 74 mph) were also recorded at New Orleans Louis Armstrong Intl Airport by an FAA wind instrument. In eastern St. Tammany Parish, wind gusts to 87 knots (100) mph were measured at Slidell by a wind tower deployed by a university. An estimated wind gust of 105 kt (120 mph) was taken at a hospital in Slidell. 

Post storm high water surveys of the area conducted by FEMA indicated the following storm surge estimates:  Orleans Parish - 12-15 feet in east New Orleans to 9 to 12 feet along the Lakefront; St. Bernard Parish - 14 to 17 feet; Jefferson Parish - 6 to 9 feet along the lakefront to 5 to 8 feet from Lafitte to Grand Isle; Plaquemines Parish - 15 to 17 feet; St. Tammany Parish - 11 to 16 feet in southeast portion to 7 to 10 feet in western portion.

Severe storm surge damage also occurred along the north shore of Lake Pontchartrain from Mandeville to Slidell with storm surge water moving inland as far as Old Towne Slidell with water up to 6 feet deep in some locations. Hurricane force winds also caused damage to roofs, power lines, and downed trees. Windows were broken in large buildings in the metro New Orleans area from wind and wind driven debris. In areas away from storm surge flooding, wind damage was widespread with fallen trees taking a heavy toll on houses and power lines, especially over St. Tammany and Washington Parishes.  Excluding losses covered by the Federal Flood Insurance Program, insured property losses in Louisiana were estimated at 22.6 billion dollars. Overall uninsured and insured losses combined were estimated to exceed 100 billion dollars along the entire Gulf Coast.

Fatalities occurring in Louisiana as a result of Hurricane Katrina numbered approximately 1097 people as of late June 2006. The majority of the victims were in the New Orleans area. 480 other Louisiana residents died in other states after evacuating..

The highest wind gust recorded in Louisiana and the adjacent coastal waters was 99 knots (114 mph) at the Grand Isle CMAN station (338 AM CDT on August 29th) before the gage failed, though higher wind gusts certainly occurred. While most of the metro New Orleans escaped the extreme winds, the extreme eastern portions of the metro area from St Bernard Parish into extreme east New Orleans experienced the western portion of the hurricane eyewall. Wind gusts between 120 to 125 mph were recorded at a couple of locations in East New Orleans. Wind gust to hurricane force (64 kt or 74 mph) were also recorded at New Orleans Louis Armstrong Intl Airport by an FAA wind instrument. In eastern St. Tammany Parish, wind gusts to 87 knots (100) mph were measured at Slidell by a wind tower deployed by a university. An estimated wind gust of 105 kt (120 mph) was taken at a hospital in Slidell. 

Post storm high water surveys of the area conducted by FEMA indicated the following storm surge estimates:  Orleans Parish - 12-15 feet in east New Orleans to 9 to 12 feet along the Lakefront; St. Bernard Parish - 14 to 17 feet; Jefferson Parish - 6 to 9 feet along the lakefront to 5 to 8 feet from Lafitte to Grand Isle; Plaquemines Parish - 15 to 17 feet; St. Tammany Parish - 11 to 16 feet in southeast portion to 7 to 10 feet in western portion.

It will likely be recorded as one the worst natural disaster in the history of the United States to date resulting in catastrophic damage and numerous casualties in southeast Louisiana and along the Mississippi coast.  Damage and casualties resulting from Hurricane Katrina extended as far east as Alabama and the panhandle of Florida.  Katrina developed from a tropical depression southeast of the Bahamas on August 24th.  After moving through the Bahamas as a tropical storm, Katrina strengthened to a category 1 hurricane prior to landfall in south Florida around the Miami area on the 25th of August.  Katrina crossed south Florida and entered the Gulf of Mexico and began to strengthen.  Hurricane Katrina strengthened to a category 5 storm on August 28th about 250 miles south southeast of the mouth of the Mississippi River with winds reaching their peak intensity of 175 mph and a central pressure of 902 mb.  Post event analysis by the National Hurricane Center indicates that Katrina weakened slightly before making landfall as a strong category 3 storm in initial landfall in lower Plaquemines Parish. Maximum sustained winds were estimated at 110 knots or 127 mph and a central pressure of 920 mb around 610 AM CDT on August 29th in southeast Louisiana just south of Buras in Plaquemines Parish.  The storm continued on a north northeast track with the center passing about 40 miles southeast of New Orleans with a second landfall occurring near the Louisiana and Mississippi border around 945 AM CDT as a Category 3 hurricane on the Saffir Simpson scale with maximum sustained winds estimated around 105 knots or 121 mph.  Katrina continued to weaken as it moved north northeast across Mississippi during the day, but remained at hurricane strength 100 miles inland near Laurel, Mississippi.  Katrina weakened to a tropical depression near Clarksville, Tennessee on August 30th.

Damage in southeast Louisiana, especially in the New Orleans area and the coastal parishes, was catastrophic.  Hurricane protection levees and floodwalls were overtopped and/or  breached resulting in widespread and deep flooding of homes and businesses.

It will likely be recorded as one the worst natural disaster in the history of the United States to date resulting in catastrophic damage and numerous casualties in southeast Louisiana and along the Mississippi coast.  Damage and casualties resulting from Hurricane Katrina extended as far east as Alabama and the panhandle of Florida.  Katrina developed from a tropical depression southeast of the Bahamas on August 24th.  After moving through the Bahamas as a tropical storm, Katrina strengthened to a category 1 hurricane prior to landfall in south Florida around the Miami area on the 25th of August.  Katrina crossed south Florida and entered the Gulf of Mexico and began to strengthen.  Hurricane Katrina strengthened to a category 5 storm on August 28th about 250 miles south southeast of the mouth of the Mississippi River with winds reaching their peak intensity of 175 mph and a central pressure of 902 mb.  Post event analysis by the National Hurricane Center indicates that Katrina weakened slightly before making landfall as a strong category 3 storm in initial landfall in lower Plaquemines Parish. Maximum sustained winds were estimated at 110 knots or 127 mph and a central pressure of 920 mb around 610 AM CDT on August 29th in southeast Louisiana just south of Buras in Plaquemines Parish.  The storm continued on a north northeast track with the center passing about 40 miles southeast of New Orleans with a second landfall occurring near the Louisiana and Mississippi border around 945 AM CDT as a Category 3 hurricane on the Saffir Simpson scale with maximum sustained winds estimated around 105 knots or 121 mph.  Katrina continued to weaken as it moved north northeast across Mississippi during the day, but remained at hurricane strength 100 miles inland near Laurel, Mississippi.  Katrina weakened to a tropical depression near Clarksville, Tennessee on August 30th.

Damage in southeast Louisiana, especially in the New Orleans area and the coastal parishes, was catastrophic.  Hurricane protection levees and floodwalls were overtopped and/or  breached resulting in widespread and deep flooding of homes and businesses.  Much of Orleans and Plaquemines Parishes and nearly all of St. Bernard Parish were flooded by storm surge. Approximately 80 percent of the city of New Orleans was flooded.  Thousands of people were stranded by the flood waters in homes and buildings and on rooftops for several days and had to be rescued by boat and helicopter. In Jefferson Parish, levees were not compromised, however many homes were flooded by either heavy rain overwhelming limited pumping capacity or storm surge water moving through in-operable pumps into the parish.  Severe storm surge damage also occurred along the north shore of Lake Pontchartrain from Mandeville to Slidell with storm surge water moving inland as far as Old Towne Slidell with water up to 6 feet deep in some locations. Hurricane force winds also caused damage to roofs, power lines, and downed trees. Windows were broken in large buildings in the metro New Orleans area from wind and wind driven debris. In areas away from storm surge flooding, wind damage was widespread with fallen trees taking a heavy toll on houses and power lines, especially over St. Tammany and Washington Parishes.  Excluding losses covered by the Federal Flood Insurance Program, insured property losses in Louisiana were estimated at 22.6 billion dollars. Overall uninsured and insured losses combined were estimated to exceed 100 billion dollars along the entire Gulf Coast.

Fatalities occurring in Louisiana as a result of Hurricane Katrina numbered approximately 1097 people as of late June 2006. The majority of the victims were in the New Orleans area. 480 other Louisiana residents died in other states after evacuating..

Hurricane Katrina strengthened to a category 5 storm on August 28th about 250 miles south southeast of the mouth of the Mississippi River with winds reaching their peak intensity of 175 mph and a central pressure of 902 mb.  Post event analysis by the National Hurricane Center indicates that Katrina weakened slightly before making landfall as a strong category 3 storm in initial landfall in lower Plaquemines Parish. Maximum sustained winds were estimated at 110 knots or 127 mph and a central pressure of 920 mb around 610 AM CDT on August 29th in southeast Louisiana just south of Buras in Plaquemines Parish.  The storm continued on a north northeast track with the center passing about 40 miles southeast of New Orleans with a second landfall occurring near the Louisiana and Mississippi border around 945 AM CDT as a Category 3 hurricane on the Saffir Simpson scale with maximum sustained winds estimated around 105 knots or 121 mph.  Katrina continued to weaken as it moved north northeast across Mississippi during the day, but remained at hurricane strength 100 miles inland near Laurel, Mississippi.  Katrina weakened to a tropical depression near Clarksville, Tennessee on August 30th.

Damage in southeast Louisiana, especially in the New Orleans area and the coastal parishes, was catastrophic.  Hurricane protection levees and floodwalls were overtopped and/or  breached resulting in widespread and deep flooding of homes and businesses.  Much of Orleans and Plaquemines Parishes and nearly all of St. Bernard Parish were flooded by storm surge. Approximately 80 percent of the city of New Orleans was flooded.  Thousands of people were stranded by the flood waters in homes and buildings and on rooftops for several days and had to be rescued by boat and helicopter. In Jefferson Parish, levees were not compromised, however many homes were flooded by either heavy rain overwhelming limited pumping capacity or storm surge water moving through in-operable pumps into the parish.  Severe storm surge damage also occurred along the north shore of Lake Pontchartrain from Mandeville to Slidell with storm surge water moving inland as far as Old Towne Slidell with water up to 6 feet deep in some locations. Hurricane force winds also caused damage to roofs, power lines, and downed trees. Windows were broken in large buildings in the metro New Orleans area from wind and wind driven debris. In areas away from storm surge flooding, wind damage was widespread with fallen trees taking a heavy toll on houses and power lines, especially over St. Tammany and Washington Parishes.  Excluding losses covered by the Federal Flood Insurance Program, insured property losses in Louisiana were estimated at 22.6 billion dollars. Overall uninsured and insured losses combined were estimated to exceed 100 billion dollars along the entire Gulf Coast.

Fatalities occurring in Louisiana as a result of Hurricane Katrina numbered approximately 1097 people as of late June 2006. The majority of the victims were in the New Orleans area. 480 other Louisiana residents died in other states after evacuating..
 Detailed information on the deaths, locations, and indirect or direct fatalities will be described in updates to Storm Data. 

Due to the failure of power and equipment prior to the peak of the storm, data for wind, storm surge, pressure, and rainfall are incomplete.  A university portable weather unit measured the lowest pressure of 920.2 mb near Buras around 0616 AM AM CDT on Aug 29th. with 934 mb being measured at the National Weather Service Office in Slidell at 938 AM CDT. 

The highest wind gust recorded in Louisiana and the adjacent coastal waters was 99 knots (114 mph) at the Grand Isle CMAN station (338 AM CDT on August 29th) before the gage failed, though higher wind gusts certainly occurred. While most of the metro New Orleans escaped the extreme winds, the extreme eastern portions of the metro area from St Bernard Parish into extreme east New Orleans experienced the western portion of the hurricane eyewall. Wind gusts between 120 to 125 mph were recorded at a couple of locations in East New Orleans. Wind gust to hurricane force (64 kt or 74 mph) were also recorded at New Orleans Louis Armstrong Intl Airport by an FAA wind instrument. In eastern St. Tammany Parish, wind gusts to 87 knots (100) mph were measured at Slidell by a wind tower deployed by a university. An estimated wind gust of 105 kt (120 mph) was taken at a hospital in Slidell. 

Post storm high water surveys of the area conducted by FEMA indicated the following storm surge estimates:  Orleans Parish - 12-15 feet in east New Orleans to 9 to 12 feet along the Lakefront; St. Bernard Parish - 14 to 17 feet; Jefferson Parish - 6 to 9 feet along the lakefront to 5 to 8 feet from Lafitte to Grand Isle; Plaquemines Parish - 15 to 17 feet; St. Tammany Parish - 11 to 16 feet in southeast portion to 7 to 10 feet in western portion.

The highest wind gust recorded in Louisiana and the adjacent coastal waters was 99 knots (114 mph) at the Grand Isle CMAN station (338 AM CDT on August 29th) before the gage failed, though higher wind gusts certainly occurred. While most of the metro New Orleans escaped the extreme winds, the extreme eastern portions of the metro area from St Bernard Parish into extreme east New Orleans experienced the western portion of the hurricane eyewall. Wind gusts between 120 to 125 mph were recorded at a couple of locations in East New Orleans. Wind gust to hurricane force (64 kt or 74 mph) were also recorded at New Orleans Louis Armstrong Intl Airport by an FAA wind instrument. In eastern St. Tammany Parish, wind gusts to 87 knots (100) mph were measured at Slidell by a wind tower deployed by a university. An estimated wind gust of 105 kt (120 mph) was taken at a hospital in Slidell. 

Post storm high water surveys of the area conducted by FEMA indicated the following storm surge estimates:  Orleans Parish - 12-15 feet in east New Orleans to 9 to 12 feet along the Lakefront; St. Bernard Parish - 14 to 17 feet; Jefferson Parish - 6 to 9 feet along the lakefront to 5 to 8 feet from Lafitte to Grand Isle; Plaquemines Parish - 15 to 17 feet; St. Tammany Parish - 11 to 16 feet in southeast portion to 7 to 10 feet in western portion.

It will likely be recorded as one the worst natural disaster in the history of the United States to date resulting in catastrophic damage and numerous casualties in southeast Louisiana and along the Mississippi coast.  Damage and casualties resulting from Hurricane Katrina extended as far east as Alabama and the panhandle of Florida.  Katrina developed from a tropical depression southeast of the Bahamas on August 24th.  After moving through the Bahamas as a tropical storm, Katrina strengthened to a category 1 hurricane prior to landfall in south Florida around the Miami area on the 25th of August.  Katrina crossed south Florida and entered the Gulf of Mexico and began to strengthen.  Hurricane Katrina strengthened to a category 5 storm on August 28th about 250 miles south southeast of the mouth of the Mississippi River with winds reaching their peak intensity of 175 mph and a central pressure of 902 mb.  Post event analysis by the National Hurricane Center indicates that Katrina weakened slightly before making landfall as a strong category 3 storm in initial landfall in lower Plaquemines Parish. Maximum sustained winds were estimated at 110 knots or 127 mph and a central pressure of 920 mb around 610 AM CDT on August 29th in southeast Louisiana just south of Buras in Plaquemines Parish.  The storm continued on a north northeast track with the center passing about 40 miles southeast of New Orleans with a second landfall occurring near the Louisiana and Mississippi border around 945 AM CDT as a Category 3 hurricane on the Saffir Simpson scale with maximum sustained winds estimated around 105 knots or 121 mph.  Katrina continued to weaken as it moved north northeast across Mississippi during the day, but remained at hurricane strength 100 miles inland near Laurel, Mississippi.  Katrina weakened to a tropical depression near Clarksville, Tennessee on August 30th.

Damage in southeast Louisiana, especially in the New Orleans area and the coastal parishes, was catastrophic.  Hurricane protection levees and floodwalls were overtopped and/or  breached resulting in widespread and deep flooding of homes and businesses.  Much of Orleans and Plaquemines Parishes and nearly all of St. Bernard Parish were flooded by storm surge. Approximately 80 percent of the city of New Orleans was flooded.  Thousands of people were stranded by the flood waters in homes and buildings and on rooftops for several days and had to be rescued by boat and helicopter. In Jefferson Parish, levees were not compromised, however many homes were flooded by either heavy rain overwhelming limited pumping capacity or storm surge water moving through in-operable pumps into the parish.  Severe storm surge damage also occurred along the north shore of Lake Pontchartrain from Mandeville to Slidell with storm surge water moving inland as far as Old Towne Slidell with water up to 6 feet deep in some locations.

Post storm high water surveys of the area conducted by FEMA indicated the following storm surge estimates:  Orleans Parish - 12-15 feet in east New Orleans to 9 to 12 feet along the Lakefront; St. Bernard Parish - 14 to 17 feet; Jefferson Parish - 6 to 9 feet along the lakefront to 5 to 8 feet from Lafitte to Grand Isle; Plaquemines Parish - 15 to 17 feet; St. Tammany Parish - 11 to 16 feet in southeast portion to 7 to 10 feet in western portion. All storm surge heights are still water elevations referenced to NAVD88 datum.   

Storm total rainfall amounts generally ranged from 7 to 14 inches with lower amounts observed farther west toward the Atchafalaya River.  A rainfall total of 11.63 inches was measured at the National Weather Service Office in Slidell.",119

It will likely be recorded as one the worst natural disaster in the history of the United States to date resulting in catastrophic damage and numerous casualties in southeast Louisiana and along the Mississippi coast.  Damage and casualties resulting from Hurricane Katrina extended as far east as Alabama and the panhandle of Florida.  Katrina developed from a tropical depression southeast of the Bahamas on August 24th.  After moving through the Bahamas as a tropical storm, Katrina strengthened to a category 1 hurricane prior to landfall in south Florida around the Miami area on the 25th of August.  Katrina crossed south Florida and entered the Gulf of Mexico and began to strengthen.  Hurricane Katrina strengthened to a category 5 storm on August 28th about 250 miles south southeast of the mouth of the Mississippi River with winds reaching their peak intensity of 175 mph and a central pressure of 902 mb.  Post event analysis by the National Hurricane Center indicates that Katrina weakened slightly before making landfall as a strong category 3 storm in initial landfall in lower Plaquemines Parish. Maximum sustained winds were estimated at 110 knots or 127 mph and a central pressure of 920 mb around 610 AM CDT on August 29th in southeast Louisiana just south of Buras in Plaquemines Parish.  The storm continued on a north northeast track with the center passing about 40 miles southeast of New Orleans with a second landfall occurring near the Louisiana and Mississippi border around 945 AM CDT as a Category 3 hurricane on the Saffir Simpson scale with maximum sustained winds estimated around 105 knots or 121 mph.  Katrina continued to weaken as it moved north northeast across Mississippi during the day, but remained at hurricane strength 100 miles inland near Laurel, Mississippi.  Katrina weakened to a tropical depression near Clarksville, Tennessee on August 30th.

Damage in southeast Louisiana, especially in the New Orleans area and the coastal parishes, was catastrophic.  Hurricane protection levees and floodwalls were overtopped and/or  breached resulting in widespread and deep flooding of homes and businesses.  Much of Orleans and Plaquemines Parishes and nearly all of St. Bernard Parish were flooded by storm surge. Approximately 80 percent of the city of New Orleans was flooded.  Thousands of people were stranded by the flood waters in homes and buildings and on rooftops for several days and had to be rescued by boat and helicopter. In Jefferson Parish, levees were not compromised, however many homes were flooded by either heavy rain overwhelming limited pumping capacity or storm surge water moving through in-operable pumps into the parish.  Severe storm surge damage also occurred along the north shore of Lake Pontchartrain from Mandeville to Slidell with storm surge water moving inland as far as Old Towne Slidell with water up to 6 feet deep in some locations. Hurricane force winds also caused damage to roofs, power lines, and downed trees. Windows were broken in large buildings in the metro New Orleans area from wind and wind driven debris. In areas away from storm surge flooding, wind damage was widespread with fallen trees taking a heavy toll on houses and power lines, especially over St. Tammany and Washington Parishes.  Excluding losses covered by the Federal Flood Insurance Program, insured property losses in Louisiana were estimated at 22.6 billion dollars. Overall uninsured and insured losses combined were estimated to exceed 100 billion dollars along the entire Gulf Coast.

Fatalities occurring in Louisiana as a result of Hurricane Katrina numbered approximately 1097 people as of late June 2006. The majority of the victims were in the New Orleans area. 480 other Louisiana residents died in other states after evacuating..
 Detailed information on the deaths, locations, and indirect or direct fatalities will be described in updates to Storm Data. 

Due to the failure of power and equipment prior to the peak of the storm, data for wind, storm surge, pressure, and rainfall are incomplete.  A university portable weather unit measured the lowest pressure of 920.2 mb near Buras around 0616 AM AM CDT on Aug 29th. with 934 mb being measured at the National Weather Service Office in Slidell at 938 AM CDT. 

The highest wind gust recorded in Louisiana and the adjacent coastal waters was 99 knots (114 mph) at the Grand Isle CMAN station (338 AM CDT on August 29th) before the gage failed, though higher wind gusts certainly occurred. While most of the metro New Orleans escaped the extreme winds, the extreme eastern portions of the metro area from St Bernard Parish into extreme east New Orleans experienced the western portion of the hurricane eyewall. Wind gusts between 120 to 125 mph were recorded at a couple of locations in East New Orleans. Wind gust to hurricane force (64 kt or 74 mph) were also recorded at New Orleans Louis Armstrong Intl Airport by an FAA wind instrument. In eastern St. Tammany Parish, wind gusts to 87 knots (100) mph were measured at Slidell by a wind tower deployed by a university.

Local levees around Lafitte and Myrtle Grove were overtopped and/or breached resulting flooding of numerous houses and property in this area.||Many areas of southeast Louisiana received 8 to 12 inches of rain with a few locations having 15 inches of rain or more.  Maximum storm total rainfall was 20.66 inches at the New Orleans Carrollton gauge on the Mississippi River.  Rainfall run-off produced moderate to major flooding on the Tangipahoa, Tchefuncte, Tickfaw, Amite, Pearl, Bogue Chitto and Bogue Falaya Rivers.

A few homes suffered more serious damage from falling trees. 100% of the parish was left without power due to a catastrophic failure of the electric system serving all of metro New Orleans.","The ninth named storm, fourth hurricane, and second major hurricane of the 2021 Atlantic hurricane season, Ida originated from a tropical wave in the Caribbean Sea on August 23rd. On August 26th, the wave developed into a tropical depression, which organized further and became Tropical Storm Ida later that day, near Grand Cayman. On a northwestward track, Ida intensified into a hurricane on August 27, just before moving over western Cuba. A day later, the hurricane underwent rapid intensification over the Gulf of Mexico as it passed over a warm core eddy and reached major hurricane strength. It was just under 72 hours from tropical depression formation to category 4 strength with 150 mph winds. Ida remained at its peak intensity of 150 mph winds and a minimum central pressure of 929 millibars as it made landfall near Port Fourchon midday on August 29th. It didn���t weaken to a tropical storm until it reached near the Louisiana/Mississippi border. ||Ida produced extensive to catastrophic damage across southeast Louisiana. On Grand Isle, around 40% of the structures were destroyed and the island was uninhabitable. Near 75% of the structures in Lafourche Parish were damaged or destroyed and likely similar numbers in Terrebonne Parish. 100+ mph wind gusts reached as far inland as Interstate 12. These winds damaged more than 30,000 poles, over 36,000 spans of wire and nearly 6,000 transformers. Of those more than 30,000 Louisiana poles, nearly 80% of those broken or damaged are from the most heavily impacted areas.|In total, the number of damaged or destroyed poles from Ida is more than hurricanes Katrina, Ike, Delta and Zeta combined. Due to major destruction to the power grid across the region, over 1 million customers were without power after landfall. Some of those power outages near the Louisiana coast lasted for around 4 weeks. |||The Louisiana Department of Health reported 3 direct fatalities and 28 indirect fatalities. Excessive heat and carbon monoxide poisoning were the most common causes of death. Indirect injuries associated with Ida: 351 heat-related, 183 carbon monoxide exposure, and 3 electrocutions. Storm surge ranged from a few feet to 10 to 15 feet. Hurricane Ida caused approximately $30 billion worth of damage.",301

There was widespread catastrophic damage to structures throughout the parish and both of the parish���s hospitals were severely damaged. An estimated 60% of homes in the parish���s bayou communities were deemed unsafe for habitation, with many losing their roof structures removed, collapsed walls, or trees falling through them. The LUMCON Marine Center in Cocodrie suffered substantial damage, and several public buildings including 2 fire departments also suffered major structural damage. Most power poles were snapped or damaged.  Nearly every road in the parish was blocked by downed trees, utility poles, or other debris. During the storm, 2 offshore vessels broke free, crashing into the Bouquet Bridge near Dulac. The entire parish was left without power and most without natural gas or water service following the storm. The strong winds and current caused damage to the parish���s main floodgate on the Houma Navigational Canal which was designed to withstand stronger forces from the south.
