Gustav brought tropical storm force winds to the area that began the end of August and continued into September 1.  The highest winds were observed during the morning of September 1. The buoy at Dauphin Island had a sustained wind of 41 MPH with a gust of 59 MPH.  The tropical storm force winds also extended over the coastal waters where no observing stations are located.  It was estimated that a couple of places north of the coast in southwest Alabama probably saw tropical storm force winds but the winds occurred where no gages were located.  No damages were observed from the winds.  Most of the damage that occurred for Gustav was from the storm surge.  The berm on Dauphin Island was washed away.

However, an NWS Mobile storm survey indicated a peak surge inundation of 6 to 8 feet along the immediate coastal areas of Bayou La Batre and Coden. Similar inundation levels occurred on the west end of Dauphin Island. 3 to 6 feet of inundation occurred in Baldwin County, with the highest surge occurring along the eastern shore of Mobile Bay and points further north in the Mobile River Delta. Approximately 25 homes on the west end of Dauphin Island were significantly flooded by the surge waters. Several other homes experienced minor damage from the surge. Several homes in the Bayou La Batre, Coden, and the Dog River area of Mobile County experienced 2 to 3 feet of flooding inside the structures due to the surge. Hundreds of piers were damaged or destroyed n Mobile and Baldwin Counties. Some coastal roads were also closed due to surge, including the US Highway 90 Causeway and Water Street in Downtown Mobile. The surge and large breaking waves also resulted in significant beach erosion along the gulf facing beaches. 6 feet of sand was deposited on a 3 mile stretch of Bienville Blvd on the west end of Dauphin Island. ||Winds gusts of 50+ mph were observed in coastal areas with a the highest wind gust of 66 mph recorded at the Mobile Regional Airport just after 2am on October 8th. The winds resulted mainly in scattered power outages and downed trees. Gusty winds did spread further inland into southwest and south central Alabama with isolated to scattered power outages and downed trees reported. ||The fast movement of Nate resulted in limited, if any, impacts from flooding. 3 to 6 inches of rain was reported across southwest and south central Alabama, with the highest totals occurring in Mobile and Baldwin Counties. ||Four EF-0 tornadoes were reported in southwest and south central Alabama: one in Mobile County, two in Baldwin County, and one in Butler County.||2 rip current fatalities occurred on October 9th in Fort Morgan due to continued high surf and widespread rip currents left in the wake of the hurricane.||Based on available information from public and individual assistance reports, total damage from Hurricane Nate in southwest Alabama is roughly estimated at just over $21 million, with the vast majority of the damage resulting from surge and major beach erosion in Mobile and Baldwin Counties.",204

However, after approximately a week of slow development, the system moved into warm Gulf of Mexico waters and rapidly intensified into a major hurricane as it moved north towards the Florida Panhandle. After a 2-day long intensification period over the eastern Gulf, Michael made landfall as an unprecedented (for the region) high-end category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale in the Florida Panhandle with maximum sustained wind speed of 155 mph and a minimum pressure 919 mb. Based on wind, Michael is the fourth most powerful hurricane to hit the United States, behind the Labor Day Hurricane (1935), Hurricane Camille (1969) and Hurricane Andrew (1992), and the most powerful storm to impact the Florida Panhandle in recorded history.  Based on central pressure, Michael is the third most powerful hurricane to hit the United States, behind only the Labor Day Hurricane (1935) and Hurricane Camille (1969).  The storm caused catastrophic damage from wind and storm surge, particularly in the Panama City Beach to Mexico Beach to Cape San Blas areas. The widespread catastrophic damage spread well inland as Hurricane Michael remained at category 3 strength into southwest Georgia.||One of the hardest hit locations was from Mexico Beach to Indian Pass where 9 to 14 feet of peak storm surge inundation was observed. In addition, wave action caused even higher total water values and this resulted in waves destroying the second story of multiple buildings in Mexico Beach.||At St. Joseph Peninsula State Park on Cape San Blas, the storm surge cut through the peninsula, creating two inlets, resulting in portions of the park no longer being accessible by vehicle. These new inlets truly demonstrate the power of storm surge.||While preliminary peak storm surge inundation was slightly less east of Indian Pass, values were still life-threatening and caused significant damage. Along the coast, portions of U.S. 98 and Alligator Drive were washed out and had to be patched/repaved. In Carrabelle, water was high enough to enter a restaurant, resulting in damage to furniture. In addition, numerous homes along the coast were destroyed or damaged as water slammed against the structures.||In addition to the life-threatening storm surge, structural damage was extensive particularly across the Florida Panhandle. Preliminary data assessments indicate almost 50,000 structures were affected across the Florida Panhandle, western Big Bend, southwest Georgia and southeast Alabama. Of these, more than 3,000 structures were destroyed. Homes and businesses were not the only structures impacted. The Hurricane Michael Preliminary Virtual Assessment Team (P-VAT) report from the Structural Extreme Event Reconnaissance Network indicated that two hospitals in Bay County, Bay Medical Sacred Heart and Gulf Coast Regional Medical Center also sustained significant damage. One hospital had glass crack and cladding stripped off the building while the other hospital had issues with power and water. Tyndall Air Force Base (AFB), that experienced the eye of Hurricane Michael, experienced catastrophic damage with every building on base experiencing some roof damage. A nearby elementary school had a portion of its roof ripped off. During the height of the storm, before the transmission stopped, a sensor at Tyndall AFB measured a gust to 139 mph.||The wind damage was not confined to the coastline, but extended well inland. In Marianna, businesses lost their roofs and the exterior wall of some buildings collapsed as the roof was lost. In Donalsonville, GA, where a 115 mph gust was measured, roof damage was also observed and at least one silo was flipped over. Even in Albany, GA, signs were blown down and roofs were peeled off buildings.||In addition to extensive structural damage, hurricane force winds caused widespread power outages across a large portion of the tri-state region. Nearly 100% of customers across a large portion of the Florida Panhandle lost power, with some of these outages lasting weeks. These widespread power outages extended into southwest Georgia with 100% of customers losing power all the way up to Lee County, GA!||Property damage estimates were still being calculated at the time of this publication and will likely rise further from what is indicated here.  However, one estimate of insured losses from the state of Florida alone was as high as $4.2 billion.||The catastrophic winds also resulted in damage to the timber and agricultural communities across Florida and Georgia. According to the Florida Forest Service, in Florida, timber damage costs estimates were over $1.2 billion dollars with almost 3 million acres of forested land damaged. In addition to damage costs, replanting in the more severely damaged areas could be an addition $240 million. This damage also has impacts to the wildfire potential with additional forest fuels from downed trees.  According to Florida Commissioner of Agriculture Adam Putnam, the state suffered nearly $1.5 billion in agricultural damages due to Michael.  The estimated damages were as follows:  Forestry $1.3 billion, Cotton $49.9 million, Cattle $43.3 million, Peanuts $23 million, Nurseries and Floriculture $16.1 million, Poultry and Eggs $10 million, Vegetables $8.6 million, Other Field Crops $7.3 million, Dairy $6.4 million, Aquaculture $5 million, Fruit $4.4 million, Tree Nuts $4.1 million, and Apiary $2 million.  ||In Georgia, 2,368,226 acres of forestland was impacted by Hurricane Michael. The estimated value of this land is $762,683,909. Catastrophic damage was mainly confined to Seminole, Decatur and Miller Counties with severe damage extending into Dougherty and Terrell Counties.  Additional crop damage occurred in Georgia to cotton, vegetables, pecans, poultry, peanuts, and timber.  According to Georgia Agriculture Commissioner Gary Black, estimated damages were as follows:  Cotton $300-$900 million, Vegetables $480 million, Pecans $560 million, Poultry $25 million, Peanuts $10-$20 million, and Timber $1 billion.||Inland flooding associated with Hurricane Michael across the tri-state region was limited as the hurricane quickly tracked across the area. A maximum rainfall total of 6.84 inches was observed near Crossroads, GA (Quitman County) with the second highest amount for the region recorded in Calhoun County, FL with 6.66 inches. With these higher rainfall amounts isolated, only a few areas of inland flooding were observed. In Bay County, record flooding was observed on the Econfina Creek at State Road 20 with 26.17 feet (NAVD88). This resulted in the SR-20 bridge being overtopped. In addition, in Calhoun County, FL, moderate flooding occurred on the Chipola River near Altha. A few homes were impacted downstream from the gauge and significant damage was sustained to the fish camps along the river.  There were no recorded tornadoes across the Florida Panhandle, Big Bend, southwest Georgia or southeast Alabama associated with Hurricane Michael.",228

In Marianna, businesses lost their roofs and the exterior wall of some buildings collapsed as the roof was lost. In Donalsonville, GA, where a 115 mph gust was measured, roof damage was also observed and at least one silo was flipped over. Even in Albany, GA, signs were blown down and roofs were peeled off buildings.||In addition to extensive structural damage, hurricane force winds caused widespread power outages across a large portion of the tri-state region. Nearly 100% of customers across a large portion of the Florida Panhandle lost power, with some of these outages lasting weeks. These widespread power outages extended into southwest Georgia with 100% of customers losing power all the way up to Lee County, GA!||Property damage estimates were still being calculated at the time of this publication and will likely rise further from what is indicated here.  However, one estimate of insured losses from the state of Florida alone was as high as $4.2 billion.||The catastrophic winds also resulted in damage to the timber and agricultural communities across Florida and Georgia. According to the Florida Forest Service, in Florida, timber damage costs estimates were over $1.2 billion dollars with almost 3 million acres of forested land damaged. In addition to damage costs, replanting in the more severely damaged areas could be an addition $240 million. This damage also has impacts to the wildfire potential with additional forest fuels from downed trees.  According to Florida Commissioner of Agriculture Adam Putnam, the state suffered nearly $1.5 billion in agricultural damages due to Michael.  The estimated damages were as follows:  Forestry $1.3 billion, Cotton $49.9 million, Cattle $43.3 million, Peanuts $23 million, Nurseries and Floriculture $16.1 million, Poultry and Eggs $10 million, Vegetables $8.6 million, Other Field Crops $7.3 million, Dairy $6.4 million, Aquaculture $5 million, Fruit $4.4 million, Tree Nuts $4.1 million, and Apiary $2 million.  ||In Georgia, 2,368,226 acres of forestland was impacted by Hurricane Michael. The estimated value of this land is $762,683,909. Catastrophic damage was mainly confined to Seminole, Decatur and Miller Counties with severe damage extending into Dougherty and Terrell Counties.  Additional crop damage occurred in Georgia to cotton, vegetables, pecans, poultry, peanuts, and timber.  According to Georgia Agriculture Commissioner Gary Black, estimated damages were as follows:  Cotton $300-$900 million, Vegetables $480 million, Pecans $560 million, Poultry $25 million, Peanuts $10-$20 million, and Timber $1 billion.||Inland flooding associated with Hurricane Michael across the tri-state region was limited as the hurricane quickly tracked across the area. A maximum rainfall total of 6.84 inches was observed near Crossroads, GA (Quitman County) with the second highest amount for the region recorded in Calhoun County, FL with 6.66 inches. With these higher rainfall amounts isolated, only a few areas of inland flooding were observed. In Bay County, record flooding was observed on the Econfina Creek at State Road 20 with 26.17 feet (NAVD88). This resulted in the SR-20 bridge being overtopped. In addition, in Calhoun County, FL, moderate flooding occurred on the Chipola River near Altha. A few homes were impacted downstream from the gauge and significant damage was sustained to the fish camps along the river.

However, after approximately a week of slow development, the system moved into warm Gulf of Mexico waters and rapidly intensified into a major hurricane as it moved north towards the Florida Panhandle. After a 2-day long intensification period over the eastern Gulf, Michael made landfall as an unprecedented (for the region) high-end category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale in the Florida Panhandle with maximum sustained wind speed of 155 mph and a minimum pressure 919 mb. Based on wind, Michael is the fourth most powerful hurricane to hit the United States, behind the Labor Day Hurricane (1935), Hurricane Camille (1969) and Hurricane Andrew (1992), and the most powerful storm to impact the Florida Panhandle in recorded history.  Based on central pressure, Michael is the third most powerful hurricane to hit the United States, behind only the Labor Day Hurricane (1935) and Hurricane Camille (1969).  The storm caused catastrophic damage from wind and storm surge, particularly in the Panama City Beach to Mexico Beach to Cape San Blas areas. The widespread catastrophic damage spread well inland as Hurricane Michael remained at category 3 strength into southwest Georgia.||One of the hardest hit locations was from Mexico Beach to Indian Pass where 9 to 14 feet of peak storm surge inundation was observed. In addition, wave action caused even higher total water values and this resulted in waves destroying the second story of multiple buildings in Mexico Beach.||At St. Joseph Peninsula State Park on Cape San Blas, the storm surge cut through the peninsula, creating two inlets, resulting in portions of the park no longer being accessible by vehicle. These new inlets truly demonstrate the power of storm surge.||While preliminary peak storm surge inundation was slightly less east of Indian Pass, values were still life-threatening and caused significant damage. Along the coast, portions of U.S. 98 and Alligator Drive were washed out and had to be patched/repaved. In Carrabelle, water was high enough to enter a restaurant, resulting in damage to furniture. In addition, numerous homes along the coast were destroyed or damaged as water slammed against the structures.||In addition to the life-threatening storm surge, structural damage was extensive particularly across the Florida Panhandle. Preliminary data assessments indicate almost 50,000 structures were affected across the Florida Panhandle, western Big Bend, southwest Georgia and southeast Alabama. Of these, more than 3,000 structures were destroyed. Homes and businesses were not the only structures impacted. The Hurricane Michael Preliminary Virtual Assessment Team (P-VAT) report from the Structural Extreme Event Reconnaissance Network indicated that two hospitals in Bay County, Bay Medical Sacred Heart and Gulf Coast Regional Medical Center also sustained significant damage.

Sally produced widespread wind, storm surge, and freshwater flooding across coastal AL and the western Florida Panhandle. Flood and wind damage also extended well inland into inland southwest Alabama and south central Alabama. Sally was an extremely slow moving hurricane, which prolonged and exacerbated the local impacts. The storm was moving at less than 5 mph at the time of landfall, resulting in a long duration of tropical storm and hurricane force winds, storm surge, and torrential rainfall. ||Storm surge and resultant damage was widespread and significant from Baldwin County eastward to Okaloosa County. The highest surge occurred in the bays and sounds of Alabama and the western Florida Panhandle, with generally lower values and lesser impacts on the immediate Gulf facing shores. A peak inundation of 7 to 9 feet above ground level was officially surveyed across some locations in the back bays and sounds of southeast Baldwin County, as well as the northern end of Escambia and Blackwater Bays. A larger area was impacted by 3 to 6 feet of inundation, including along the immediate Gulf facing shores. It should be noted that the extremely heavy rainfall (more details to follow) likely exacerbated the total water levels, although it is difficult to determine the exact extent. Regardless, thousands of structures along coastal areas were flooded by the surge. ||Wind damage was extensive across the region, especially in areas that experienced the eyewall of Sally over a several hour duration. Wind damage was most extensive from southeast Mobile County eastward across Baldwin County AL into Escambia County FL. These locations experienced prolonged hurricane conditions with wind gusts over 100 mph, especially close to the immediate coast. Many homes across the area suffered roof damage from the winds and an untold number of homes were damaged by fallen trees. The tree damage was most extensive in Baldwin County, but also significant in parts of Mobile and Escambia Counties which experienced hurricane conditions. The pecan farms of Baldwin County took a major hit with well over a thousand pecan trees downed throughout the county.||The very slow movement of Sally resulted in rainfall totals of 15 to 30 inches across Baldwin County into the western Florida Panhandle. 7 to 15 inches of rain fell across parts of inland southwest Alabama, along and east of Interstate 65, and south central Alabama. This torrential rain resulted in major river and flash flooding, especially in Baldwin County eastward into the Florida Panhandle. Thousands of water rescues were conducted during the storm due to rapidly rising water and many homes were flooded. Road closures were extensive, especially in Baldwin County east into the western Florida Panhandle and some roads were damaged or washed out. Several rivers reached moderate to major flood stage and some crested within the top 5 of their historical crests. ||There were 3 direct fatalities as a result of Sally. One fatality occurred in the Wolf Bay area (Baldwin County AL.) Two men were riding the storm out on their boat and at some point during the storm attempted to swim to shore. One of the men made it to a pier and was rescued and hospitalised; the other man drowned. The second fatality occurred on Innerarity Point, FL (Escambia County FL) where a 45 year old woman drowned when the vehicle she was driving was overtaken by the incoming storm surge. The third fatality occurred in Perdido Key, FL (Escambia County FL) when a 27 year old man drowned trying to retrieve a boat that was swept away by the surge and high surf. ||There were also 3 indirect fatalities. One was due to storm cleanup in the Foley, AL area with two others (one in both Baldwin County and Escambia County FL) due to carbon monoxide poisoning from improper generator use.||The total reported damage from Public Assistance (PA) and Individual Assistance (IA) is near $550 million. Note that this does not include insured losses and damages. Also, not all county reports were available or finalized at the time of this publication. A breakdown of costs related to each individual hazard was unavailable. All damages are listed under either the Hurricane or Tropical Storm hazard, but it should be noted that a good portion of the damage was caused by storm surge or flooding even though it is not explicitly listed. ||Timber loss was extensive. The Alabama Forestry Commission estimates that 2,440 forested acres were damaged with 79,175 tons of timber destroyed at a value of $1,564,160. Most of this occurred in Baldwin County. ||A study by the University of Florida estimates that total agricultural losses in the western Florida Panhandle ranged from $55 to $100 million.||Here is a breakdown of county by county impacts:||Mobile County AL: The greatest impact of Sally in Mobile County was to Dauphin Island, which was impacted by the western eyewall of Sally for a long duration. Hurricane force winds with gusts over 100 mph were recorded on the island. Winds were out of the north, which resulted in the bay and sound side of the island being the most impacted. Several buildings experienced roof and siding damage, including to two buildings on the campus of the Dauphin Island Sea Lab. Another home on the island lost its roof entirely. A 3 to 4 foot storm surge on the north side of the island resulted in major damage to docks and piers, including at the Dauphin Island marina. Across mainland Mobile county, the southern and central portions of the county experienced a long duration of sustained tropical storm force winds with hurricane force wind gusts recorded all the way west at the Mobile Regional Airport. In fact, the 82 mph gust recorded at the airport was almost as high as the peak gust recorded in Hurricane Katrina of 83 mph. Numerous trees and power lines were downed across the county, especially in central and southern parts of the county. This resulted in widespread power outages. Mobile's Bienville Square suffered major damage to the numerous oaks in the area and there was minor damage reported at some businesses in downtown Mobile. Several homes in the county also experienced roof, siding, and fence damage. Downed trees also damaged some homes. ||Baldwin County AL: The county experienced widespread damage as the eye of Sally moved across a large portion of the county after making landfall in Gulf Shores, AL. A large|storm surge resulted in widespread inundation and major flood damage to structures along the back bay waters with little to no structural damage to buildings along the Gulf facing beaches. There was a walkway at the Cotton Bayou Gulf access that was damaged. The greatest surge occurred east of Gulf Shores across Orange Beach to the Florida State line and all the way north into the northern portion of Perdido Bay, as well as Wolf Bay. Peak inundation was surveyed to be 7 to 9 feet above ground with a much larger area that experienced 3 to 6 feet of inundation. Surge values neared 10 feet above ground at the far western end of Cotton Bayou in Orange Beach. Numerous large boats were moved onto land by the surge. Almost all piers were destroyed and several marinas were heavily damaged. The Gulf State Park Pier in Gulf Shores was also majorly damaged with a large section of the pier now missing. The 20 to 30 inches of rain that fell across the southern part of the county certainly compounded the storm surge flooding and also resulted in widespread flash flooding and river flooding. The Fish and Styx Rivers reached major flood stage and experienced their third and second highest crests respectively. The eyewall of Sally resulted in widespread and extensive damage to trees and power lines. Most of southern Baldwin county experienced sustained hurricane force winds of 75 to 85 mph with gusts over 100 mph. A sailboat anchored in Ingram Bayou measured a 1 minute sustained wind of 113 mph with a gust to 137 mph. These measurements were recorded at an elevated 58 feet. When reduced to the standard measuring height 33 feet, the sustained wind is estimated to have been 104 mph with a gust to 126 mph. The Center of Severe Weather Research recorded a 123 mph gust on the east side of the Perdido Pass bridge from an anemometer on their mobile doppler radar unit with sustained winds of 93 mph. Numerous structures were damaged by fallen trees and many structures in the county suffered significant roof and siding damage. In Ft. Morgan, a few older homes were destroyed and a boat storage facility at a marina suffered major damage. Almost all of the county lost power during the storm due to substantial damage to the power infrastructure. The pecan farming industry took a devastating hit as likely over a thousand pecan trees were destroyed across the county. There were three fatalities from the storm, one direct and two indirect. A person drowned in Orange Beach during the storm. Another fatality occurred in Foley during the post storm clean up and another individual died due to carbon monoxide poisoning from a generator.||Escambia County FL: A combination of strong wind and storm surge resulted in widespread damage to Escambia County. To date, 1,756 structures were damaged. 44 structures were destroyed and 629 suffered major damage. Hurricane force winds resulted in siding and roof damage to many structures, with downed trees also playing a large role in damage to some|structures. Power outages were widespread. Pensacola NAS recorded sustained hurricane force winds with gusts of 92 mph. A large storm surge impacted the county, with the highest surge occurring in the Perdido Key area and along portions of Pensacola and Escambia Bays. Peak inundation of 7 to 9 feet above ground level was surveyed across the northern portions of Pensacola, Escambia, and Blackwater Bays. The tidal gauge at the Port of Pensacola measured an inundation of 5.6 feet, the third highest surge ever recorded (Ivan and the 1926 hurricane are #1 and #2.) Numerous structures had significant damage from storm surge inundation. Numerous large boats and barges were moved onto land by the surge. A portion of the Three Mile bridge across Pensacola Bay collapsed due to damage from the barges. The vast majority of the storm surge structural damage occurred along the back bays and sounds and not along the immediate Gulf facing beaches. However, significant damage occurred along the Gulf islands national seashore, particularly in the Johnson Beach and Ft. Pickens area. On Johnson Beach, the surge and wave action took out a large portion of the first line of dunes with damage even noted to some of the second line dunes. 4 to 5 ft of sand covered Johnson Beach road with damage to the road itself. Noaa aerial imagery indicates that 3 new cuts were created on the far east side of Johnson Beach. The surge along the Gulf side of Perdido Key was also significant (7-9 feet) as the water line encroached upon the entrance of some of the condos and damaged walkways and pools. The copious amounts of rain (15-30 inches) also compounded the storm surge issue as water that normally would drain into area bays, rivers, creeks, and streams had nowhere to go due to the incoming storm surge. Downtown Pensacola was one notable area hard hit by this fresh water flooding, but countless other locations, especially across central and southern Escambia county, were also hard hit by this flooding. There were 3 reported fatalities, two direct and one indirect. One person died while trying to retrieve a boat during the storm and another person died while kayaking during the storm. One person died after the storm due to carbon monoxide from a generator being run indoors.||Santa Rosa County, FL: A large storm surge had its greatest impact on the sound and bay|sides of Santa Rosa county. The largest surge occurred in the northern half of Escambia Bay as well as in Blackwater and East Bay. Peak surge inundation reached 7 to 9 feet above ground level. Numerous homes suffered significant inundation from the surge. The surge flooding was compounded by 20+ inches of rain that fell which also resulted in significant to major flash flooding and river flooding. Hurricane force wind gusts also resulted in roof and siding damage to many homes, extensive downed trees, and power lines. To date, around 1,400 residential structures have been identified as being impacted with 6 being destroyed and 139 suffering major damage. 19 commercial buildings have been documented as being impacted with major damage to 4 buildings. ||Okaloosa County, FL: A long duration of tropical storm force winds impacted Okaloosa County as the center of Hurricane Sally tracked very slowly to the east and north of the county. Significant storm surge impacted coastal areas, especially in western parts of Okaloosa county closer to the Santa Rosa line. Many homes on the sound side of the Mary Esther area were inundated by the surge flooding. Portions of Highway 98 on Okaloosa Island were breached by the surge flooding, however the road was not damaged. A 2 ft seawall was breached in Ft. Walton Beach with 2 to 3 ft of water covered adjacent portions of Highway 98. Walkovers and beach side docks were displaced on the Gulf side. A few restaurants and homes suffered some flooding along Calhoun avenue, likely from a combination of the torrential rainfall and storm surge. The copious rainfall also resulted in flash flooding and major river flooding, which also flooded homes in the county.||Escambia County, AL:|Widespread trees were downed throughout Escambia county, AL. Some of the trees fell onto homes, but most of the damage was minor. However, 4 homes suffered major damage from the fallen trees. At the peak of the event, 85% of the county was without power. Torrential rainfall|of 10 to 20 inches led to flash flooding and river flooding, resulting in the 10 county roads becoming impassable during the storm. Some of the roads suffered wash outs. A couple of bridges experienced wash outs as well.||Covington County, AL:|Five homes suffered wind damage as tropical storm force winds impacted Covington county. Trees and power lines were downed which resulted in some power outages. Numerous roads were flooded and impassable. Several roads also suffered wash outs due to the extensive flooding.|||Crenshaw County, AL: Tropical storm force wind gusts downed some trees and power lines in|the county. Significant flooding also occurred, especially in the southern half of the county. Numerous roads were impassable and some experienced washouts.||Monroe County, AL: Tropical storm conditions downed numerous trees and power lines|across Monroe county.||Clarke County, AL:  Tropical storm force winds downed trees across Clarke county. One tree|fell onto a home in Grove Hill, resulting in significant damage.||Conecuh County, AL: Tropical storm force winds downed trees and power lines in Conecuh|County.||Butler County, AL:  Tropical storm conditions downed trees and power lines across portions of Butler county. A few homes suffered minor damage from fallen trees. Scattered power outages were reported. A few roads were flooded from heavy rain.",242

Sally produced widespread wind, storm surge, and freshwater flooding across coastal AL and the western Florida Panhandle. Flood and wind damage also extended well inland into inland southwest Alabama and south central Alabama. Sally was an extremely slow moving hurricane, which prolonged and exacerbated the local impacts. The storm was moving at less than 5 mph at the time of landfall, resulting in a long duration of tropical storm and hurricane force winds, storm surge, and torrential rainfall. ||Storm surge and resultant damage was widespread and significant from Baldwin County eastward to Okaloosa County. The highest surge occurred in the bays and sounds of Alabama and the western Florida Panhandle, with generally lower values and lesser impacts on the immediate Gulf facing shores. A peak inundation of 7 to 9 feet above ground level was officially surveyed across some locations in the back bays and sounds of southeast Baldwin County, as well as the northern end of Escambia and Blackwater Bays. A larger area was impacted by 3 to 6 feet of inundation, including along the immediate Gulf facing shores. It should be noted that the extremely heavy rainfall (more details to follow) likely exacerbated the total water levels, although it is difficult to determine the exact extent. Regardless, thousands of structures along coastal areas were flooded by the surge. ||Wind damage was extensive across the region, especially in areas that experienced the eyewall of Sally over a several hour duration. Wind damage was most extensive from southeast Mobile County eastward across Baldwin County AL into Escambia County FL. These locations experienced prolonged hurricane conditions with wind gusts over 100 mph, especially close to the immediate coast. Many homes across the area suffered roof damage from the winds and an untold number of homes were damaged by fallen trees. The tree damage was most extensive in Baldwin County, but also significant in parts of Mobile and Escambia Counties which experienced hurricane conditions. The pecan farms of Baldwin County took a major hit with well over a thousand pecan trees downed throughout the county.||The very slow movement of Sally resulted in rainfall totals of 15 to 30 inches across Baldwin County into the western Florida Panhandle. 7 to 15 inches of rain fell across parts of inland southwest Alabama, along and east of Interstate 65, and south central Alabama. This torrential rain resulted in major river and flash flooding, especially in Baldwin County eastward into the Florida Panhandle. Thousands of water rescues were conducted during the storm due to rapidly rising water and many homes were flooded. Road closures were extensive, especially in Baldwin County east into the western Florida Panhandle and some roads were damaged or washed out. Several rivers reached moderate to major flood stage and some crested within the top 5 of their historical crests. ||There were 3 direct fatalities as a result of Sally. One fatality occurred in the Wolf Bay area (Baldwin County AL.) Two men were riding the storm out on their boat and at some point during the storm attempted to swim to shore. One of the men made it to a pier and was rescued and hospitalised; the other man drowned. The second fatality occurred on Innerarity Point, FL (Escambia County FL) where a 45 year old woman drowned when the vehicle she was driving was overtaken by the incoming storm surge. The third fatality occurred in Perdido Key, FL (Escambia County FL) when a 27 year old man drowned trying to retrieve a boat that was swept away by the surge and high surf. ||There were also 3 indirect fatalities.

A large storm surge impacted the county, with the highest surge occurring in the Perdido Key area and along portions of Pensacola and Escambia Bays. Peak inundation of 7 to 9 feet above ground level was surveyed across the northern portions of Pensacola, Escambia, and Blackwater Bays. The tidal gauge at the Port of Pensacola measured an inundation of 5.6 feet, the third highest surge ever recorded (Ivan and the 1926 hurricane are #1 and #2.) Numerous structures had significant damage from storm surge inundation. Numerous large boats and barges were moved onto land by the surge. A portion of the Three Mile bridge across Pensacola Bay collapsed due to damage from the barges. The vast majority of the storm surge structural damage occurred along the back bays and sounds and not along the immediate Gulf facing beaches. However, significant damage occurred along the Gulf islands national seashore, particularly in the Johnson Beach and Ft. Pickens area. On Johnson Beach, the surge and wave action took out a large portion of the first line of dunes with damage even noted to some of the second line dunes. 4 to 5 ft of sand covered Johnson Beach road with damage to the road itself. Noaa aerial imagery indicates that 3 new cuts were created on the far east side of Johnson Beach. The surge along the Gulf side of Perdido Key was also significant (7-9 feet) as the water line encroached upon the entrance of some of the condos and damaged walkways and pools. The copious amounts of rain (15-30 inches) also compounded the storm surge issue as water that normally would drain into area bays, rivers, creeks, and streams had nowhere to go due to the incoming storm surge. Downtown Pensacola was one notable area hard hit by this fresh water flooding, but countless other locations, especially across central and southern Escambia county, were also hard hit by this flooding. There were 3 reported fatalities, two direct and one indirect. One person died while trying to retrieve a boat during the storm and another person died while kayaking during the storm. One person died after the storm due to carbon monoxide from a generator being run indoors.||Santa Rosa County, FL: A large storm surge had its greatest impact on the sound and bay|sides of Santa Rosa county. The largest surge occurred in the northern half of Escambia Bay as well as in Blackwater and East Bay. Peak surge inundation reached 7 to 9 feet above ground level. Numerous homes suffered significant inundation from the surge. The surge flooding was compounded by 20+ inches of rain that fell which also resulted in significant to major flash flooding and river flooding. Hurricane force wind gusts also resulted in roof and siding damage to many homes, extensive downed trees, and power lines. To date, around 1,400 residential structures have been identified as being impacted with 6 being destroyed and 139 suffering major damage. 19 commercial buildings have been documented as being impacted with major damage to 4 buildings. ||Okaloosa County, FL: A long duration of tropical storm force winds impacted Okaloosa County as the center of Hurricane Sally tracked very slowly to the east and north of the county. Significant storm surge impacted coastal areas, especially in western parts of Okaloosa county closer to the Santa Rosa line. Many homes on the sound side of the Mary Esther area were inundated by the surge flooding. Portions of Highway 98 on Okaloosa Island were breached by the surge flooding, however the road was not damaged. A 2 ft seawall was breached in Ft. Walton Beach with 2 to 3 ft of water covered adjacent portions of Highway 98. Walkovers and beach side docks were displaced on the Gulf side. A few restaurants and homes suffered some flooding along Calhoun avenue, likely from a combination of the torrential rainfall and storm surge. The copious rainfall also resulted in flash flooding and major river flooding, which also flooded homes in the county.||Escambia County, AL:|Widespread trees were downed throughout Escambia county, AL. Some of the trees fell onto homes, but most of the damage was minor. However, 4 homes suffered major damage from the fallen trees. At the peak of the event, 85% of the county was without power. Torrential rainfall|of 10 to 20 inches led to flash flooding and river flooding, resulting in the 10 county roads becoming impassable during the storm. Some of the roads suffered wash outs. A couple of bridges experienced wash outs as well.||Covington County, AL:|Five homes suffered wind damage as tropical storm force winds impacted Covington county. Trees and power lines were downed which resulted in some power outages. Numerous roads were flooded and impassable. Several roads also suffered wash outs due to the extensive flooding.|||Crenshaw County, AL: Tropical storm force wind gusts downed some trees and power lines in|the county. Significant flooding also occurred, especially in the southern half of the county. Numerous roads were impassable and some experienced washouts.||Monroe County, AL: Tropical storm conditions downed numerous trees and power lines|across Monroe county.||Clarke County, AL:  Tropical storm force winds downed trees across Clarke county. One tree|fell onto a home in Grove Hill, resulting in significant damage.||Conecuh County, AL: Tropical storm force winds downed trees and power lines in Conecuh|County.||Butler County, AL:  Tropical storm conditions downed trees and power lines across portions of Butler county.

Sally produced widespread wind, storm surge, and freshwater flooding across coastal AL and the western Florida Panhandle. Flood and wind damage also extended well inland into inland southwest Alabama and south central Alabama. Sally was an extremely slow moving hurricane, which prolonged and exacerbated the local impacts. The storm was moving at less than 5 mph at the time of landfall, resulting in a long duration of tropical storm and hurricane force winds, storm surge, and torrential rainfall. ||Storm surge and resultant damage was widespread and significant from Baldwin County eastward to Okaloosa County. The highest surge occurred in the bays and sounds of Alabama and the western Florida Panhandle, with generally lower values and lesser impacts on the immediate Gulf facing shores. A peak inundation of 7 to 9 feet above ground level was officially surveyed across some locations in the back bays and sounds of southeast Baldwin County, as well as the northern end of Escambia and Blackwater Bays. A larger area was impacted by 3 to 6 feet of inundation, including along the immediate Gulf facing shores. It should be noted that the extremely heavy rainfall (more details to follow) likely exacerbated the total water levels, although it is difficult to determine the exact extent. Regardless, thousands of structures along coastal areas were flooded by the surge. ||Wind damage was extensive across the region, especially in areas that experienced the eyewall of Sally over a several hour duration. Wind damage was most extensive from southeast Mobile County eastward across Baldwin County AL into Escambia County FL. These locations experienced prolonged hurricane conditions with wind gusts over 100 mph, especially close to the immediate coast. Many homes across the area suffered roof damage from the winds and an untold number of homes were damaged by fallen trees. The tree damage was most extensive in Baldwin County, but also significant in parts of Mobile and Escambia Counties which experienced hurricane conditions. The pecan farms of Baldwin County took a major hit with well over a thousand pecan trees downed throughout the county.||The very slow movement of Sally resulted in rainfall totals of 15 to 30 inches across Baldwin County into the western Florida Panhandle. 7 to 15 inches of rain fell across parts of inland southwest Alabama, along and east of Interstate 65, and south central Alabama. This torrential rain resulted in major river and flash flooding, especially in Baldwin County eastward into the Florida Panhandle. Thousands of water rescues were conducted during the storm due to rapidly rising water and many homes were flooded. Road closures were extensive, especially in Baldwin County east into the western Florida Panhandle and some roads were damaged or washed out. Several rivers reached moderate to major flood stage and some crested within the top 5 of their historical crests. ||There were 3 direct fatalities as a result of Sally. One fatality occurred in the Wolf Bay area (Baldwin County AL.) Two men were riding the storm out on their boat and at some point during the storm attempted to swim to shore. One of the men made it to a pier and was rescued and hospitalised; the other man drowned. The second fatality occurred on Innerarity Point, FL (Escambia County FL) where a 45 year old woman drowned when the vehicle she was driving was overtaken by the incoming storm surge. The third fatality occurred in Perdido Key, FL (Escambia County FL) when a 27 year old man drowned trying to retrieve a boat that was swept away by the surge and high surf. ||There were also 3 indirect fatalities. One was due to storm cleanup in the Foley, AL area with two others (one in both Baldwin County and Escambia County FL) due to carbon monoxide poisoning from improper generator use.||The total reported damage from Public Assistance (PA) and Individual Assistance (IA) is near $550 million. Note that this does not include insured losses and damages. Also, not all county reports were available or finalized at the time of this publication. A breakdown of costs related to each individual hazard was unavailable. All damages are listed under either the Hurricane or Tropical Storm hazard, but it should be noted that a good portion of the damage was caused by storm surge or flooding even though it is not explicitly listed. ||Timber loss was extensive. The Alabama Forestry Commission estimates that 2,440 forested acres were damaged with 79,175 tons of timber destroyed at a value of $1,564,160. Most of this occurred in Baldwin County. ||A study by the University of Florida estimates that total agricultural losses in the western Florida Panhandle ranged from $55 to $100 million.||Here is a breakdown of county by county impacts:||Mobile County AL: The greatest impact of Sally in Mobile County was to Dauphin Island, which was impacted by the western eyewall of Sally for a long duration. Hurricane force winds with gusts over 100 mph were recorded on the island. Winds were out of the north, which resulted in the bay and sound side of the island being the most impacted. Several buildings experienced roof and siding damage, including to two buildings on the campus of the Dauphin Island Sea Lab. Another home on the island lost its roof entirely. A 3 to 4 foot storm surge on the north side of the island resulted in major damage to docks and piers, including at the Dauphin Island marina. Across mainland Mobile county, the southern and central portions of the county experienced a long duration of sustained tropical storm force winds with hurricane force wind gusts recorded all the way west at the Mobile Regional Airport. In fact, the 82 mph gust recorded at the airport was almost as high as the peak gust recorded in Hurricane Katrina of 83 mph. Numerous trees and power lines were downed across the county, especially in central and southern parts of the county. This resulted in widespread power outages. Mobile's Bienville Square suffered major damage to the numerous oaks in the area and there was minor damage reported at some businesses in downtown Mobile. Several homes in the county also experienced roof, siding, and fence damage. Downed trees also damaged some homes. ||Baldwin County AL: The county experienced widespread damage as the eye of Sally moved across a large portion of the county after making landfall in Gulf Shores, AL. A large|storm surge resulted in widespread inundation and major flood damage to structures along the back bay waters with little to no structural damage to buildings along the Gulf facing beaches. There was a walkway at the Cotton Bayou Gulf access that was damaged. The greatest surge occurred east of Gulf Shores across Orange Beach to the Florida State line and all the way north into the northern portion of Perdido Bay, as well as Wolf Bay. Peak inundation was surveyed to be 7 to 9 feet above ground with a much larger area that experienced 3 to 6 feet of inundation. Surge values neared 10 feet above ground at the far western end of Cotton Bayou in Orange Beach. Numerous large boats were moved onto land by the surge. Almost all piers were destroyed and several marinas were heavily damaged. The Gulf State Park Pier in Gulf Shores was also majorly damaged with a large section of the pier now missing. The 20 to 30 inches of rain that fell across the southern part of the county certainly compounded the storm surge flooding and also resulted in widespread flash flooding and river flooding. The Fish and Styx Rivers reached major flood stage and experienced their third and second highest crests respectively. The eyewall of Sally resulted in widespread and extensive damage to trees and power lines. Most of southern Baldwin county experienced sustained hurricane force winds of 75 to 85 mph with gusts over 100 mph. A sailboat anchored in Ingram Bayou measured a 1 minute sustained wind of 113 mph with a gust to 137 mph. These measurements were recorded at an elevated 58 feet. When reduced to the standard measuring height 33 feet, the sustained wind is estimated to have been 104 mph with a gust to 126 mph. The Center of Severe Weather Research recorded a 123 mph gust on the east side of the Perdido Pass bridge from an anemometer on their mobile doppler radar unit with sustained winds of 93 mph. Numerous structures were damaged by fallen trees and many structures in the county suffered significant roof and siding damage. In Ft. Morgan, a few older homes were destroyed and a boat storage facility at a marina suffered major damage. Almost all of the county lost power during the storm due to substantial damage to the power infrastructure. The pecan farming industry took a devastating hit as likely over a thousand pecan trees were destroyed across the county. There were three fatalities from the storm, one direct and two indirect. A person drowned in Orange Beach during the storm. Another fatality occurred in Foley during the post storm clean up and another individual died due to carbon monoxide poisoning from a generator.||Escambia County FL: A combination of strong wind and storm surge resulted in widespread damage to Escambia County. To date, 1,756 structures were damaged. 44 structures were destroyed and 629 suffered major damage. Hurricane force winds resulted in siding and roof damage to many structures, with downed trees also playing a large role in damage to some|structures. Power outages were widespread.

Sally produced widespread wind, storm surge, and freshwater flooding across coastal AL and the western Florida Panhandle. Flood and wind damage also extended well inland into inland southwest Alabama and south central Alabama. Sally was an extremely slow moving hurricane, which prolonged and exacerbated the local impacts. The storm was moving at less than 5 mph at the time of landfall, resulting in a long duration of tropical storm and hurricane force winds, storm surge, and torrential rainfall. ||Storm surge and resultant damage was widespread and significant from Baldwin County eastward to Okaloosa County. The highest surge occurred in the bays and sounds of Alabama and the western Florida Panhandle, with generally lower values and lesser impacts on the immediate Gulf facing shores. A peak inundation of 7 to 9 feet above ground level was officially surveyed across some locations in the back bays and sounds of southeast Baldwin County, as well as the northern end of Escambia and Blackwater Bays. A larger area was impacted by 3 to 6 feet of inundation, including along the immediate Gulf facing shores. It should be noted that the extremely heavy rainfall (more details to follow) likely exacerbated the total water levels, although it is difficult to determine the exact extent. Regardless, thousands of structures along coastal areas were flooded by the surge. ||Wind damage was extensive across the region, especially in areas that experienced the eyewall of Sally over a several hour duration. Wind damage was most extensive from southeast Mobile County eastward across Baldwin County AL into Escambia County FL. These locations experienced prolonged hurricane conditions with wind gusts over 100 mph, especially close to the immediate coast. Many homes across the area suffered roof damage from the winds and an untold number of homes were damaged by fallen trees. The tree damage was most extensive in Baldwin County, but also significant in parts of Mobile and Escambia Counties which experienced hurricane conditions. The pecan farms of Baldwin County took a major hit with well over a thousand pecan trees downed throughout the county.||The very slow movement of Sally resulted in rainfall totals of 15 to 30 inches across Baldwin County into the western Florida Panhandle. 7 to 15 inches of rain fell across parts of inland southwest Alabama, along and east of Interstate 65, and south central Alabama. This torrential rain resulted in major river and flash flooding, especially in Baldwin County eastward into the Florida Panhandle. Thousands of water rescues were conducted during the storm due to rapidly rising water and many homes were flooded. Road closures were extensive, especially in Baldwin County east into the western Florida Panhandle and some roads were damaged or washed out. Several rivers reached moderate to major flood stage and some crested within the top 5 of their historical crests. ||There were 3 direct fatalities as a result of Sally. One fatality occurred in the Wolf Bay area (Baldwin County AL.) Two men were riding the storm out on their boat and at some point during the storm attempted to swim to shore. One of the men made it to a pier and was rescued and hospitalised; the other man drowned. The second fatality occurred on Innerarity Point, FL (Escambia County FL) where a 45 year old woman drowned when the vehicle she was driving was overtaken by the incoming storm surge. The third fatality occurred in Perdido Key, FL (Escambia County FL) when a 27 year old man drowned trying to retrieve a boat that was swept away by the surge and high surf. ||There were also 3 indirect fatalities. One was due to storm cleanup in the Foley, AL area with two others (one in both Baldwin County and Escambia County FL) due to carbon monoxide poisoning from improper generator use.||The total reported damage from Public Assistance (PA) and Individual Assistance (IA) is near $550 million. Note that this does not include insured losses and damages. Also, not all county reports were available or finalized at the time of this publication. A breakdown of costs related to each individual hazard was unavailable. All damages are listed under either the Hurricane or Tropical Storm hazard, but it should be noted that a good portion of the damage was caused by storm surge or flooding even though it is not explicitly listed. ||Timber loss was extensive. The Alabama Forestry Commission estimates that 2,440 forested acres were damaged with 79,175 tons of timber destroyed at a value of $1,564,160. Most of this occurred in Baldwin County. ||A study by the University of Florida estimates that total agricultural losses in the western Florida Panhandle ranged from $55 to $100 million.||Here is a breakdown of county by county impacts:||Mobile County AL: The greatest impact of Sally in Mobile County was to Dauphin Island, which was impacted by the western eyewall of Sally for a long duration. Hurricane force winds with gusts over 100 mph were recorded on the island. Winds were out of the north, which resulted in the bay and sound side of the island being the most impacted. Several buildings experienced roof and siding damage, including to two buildings on the campus of the Dauphin Island Sea Lab. Another home on the island lost its roof entirely. A 3 to 4 foot storm surge on the north side of the island resulted in major damage to docks and piers, including at the Dauphin Island marina. Across mainland Mobile county, the southern and central portions of the county experienced a long duration of sustained tropical storm force winds with hurricane force wind gusts recorded all the way west at the Mobile Regional Airport. In fact, the 82 mph gust recorded at the airport was almost as high as the peak gust recorded in Hurricane Katrina of 83 mph. Numerous trees and power lines were downed across the county, especially in central and southern parts of the county. This resulted in widespread power outages. Mobile's Bienville Square suffered major damage to the numerous oaks in the area and there was minor damage reported at some businesses in downtown Mobile. Several homes in the county also experienced roof, siding, and fence damage. Downed trees also damaged some homes. ||Baldwin County AL: The county experienced widespread damage as the eye of Sally moved across a large portion of the county after making landfall in Gulf Shores, AL. A large|storm surge resulted in widespread inundation and major flood damage to structures along the back bay waters with little to no structural damage to buildings along the Gulf facing beaches. There was a walkway at the Cotton Bayou Gulf access that was damaged. The greatest surge occurred east of Gulf Shores across Orange Beach to the Florida State line and all the way north into the northern portion of Perdido Bay, as well as Wolf Bay. Peak inundation was surveyed to be 7 to 9 feet above ground with a much larger area that experienced 3 to 6 feet of inundation. Surge values neared 10 feet above ground at the far western end of Cotton Bayou in Orange Beach. Numerous large boats were moved onto land by the surge. Almost all piers were destroyed and several marinas were heavily damaged. The Gulf State Park Pier in Gulf Shores was also majorly damaged with a large section of the pier now missing. The 20 to 30 inches of rain that fell across the southern part of the county certainly compounded the storm surge flooding and also resulted in widespread flash flooding and river flooding. The Fish and Styx Rivers reached major flood stage and experienced their third and second highest crests respectively. The eyewall of Sally resulted in widespread and extensive damage to trees and power lines. Most of southern Baldwin county experienced sustained hurricane force winds of 75 to 85 mph with gusts over 100 mph. A sailboat anchored in Ingram Bayou measured a 1 minute sustained wind of 113 mph with a gust to 137 mph. These measurements were recorded at an elevated 58 feet. When reduced to the standard measuring height 33 feet, the sustained wind is estimated to have been 104 mph with a gust to 126 mph. The Center of Severe Weather Research recorded a 123 mph gust on the east side of the Perdido Pass bridge from an anemometer on their mobile doppler radar unit with sustained winds of 93 mph. Numerous structures were damaged by fallen trees and many structures in the county suffered significant roof and siding damage. In Ft. Morgan, a few older homes were destroyed and a boat storage facility at a marina suffered major damage. Almost all of the county lost power during the storm due to substantial damage to the power infrastructure. The pecan farming industry took a devastating hit as likely over a thousand pecan trees were destroyed across the county. There were three fatalities from the storm, one direct and two indirect. A person drowned in Orange Beach during the storm. Another fatality occurred in Foley during the post storm clean up and another individual died due to carbon monoxide poisoning from a generator.||Escambia County FL: A combination of strong wind and storm surge resulted in widespread damage to Escambia County. To date, 1,756 structures were damaged. 44 structures were destroyed and 629 suffered major damage. Hurricane force winds resulted in siding and roof damage to many structures, with downed trees also playing a large role in damage to some|structures. Power outages were widespread. Pensacola NAS recorded sustained hurricane force winds with gusts of 92 mph. A large storm surge impacted the county, with the highest surge occurring in the Perdido Key area and along portions of Pensacola and Escambia Bays. Peak inundation of 7 to 9 feet above ground level was surveyed across the northern portions of Pensacola, Escambia, and Blackwater Bays. The tidal gauge at the Port of Pensacola measured an inundation of 5.6 feet, the third highest surge ever recorded (Ivan and the 1926 hurricane are #1 and #2.) Numerous structures had significant damage from storm surge inundation. Numerous large boats and barges were moved onto land by the surge. A portion of the Three Mile bridge across Pensacola Bay collapsed due to damage from the barges. The vast majority of the storm surge structural damage occurred along the back bays and sounds and not along the immediate Gulf facing beaches. However, significant damage occurred along the Gulf islands national seashore, particularly in the Johnson Beach and Ft. Pickens area. On Johnson Beach, the surge and wave action took out a large portion of the first line of dunes with damage even noted to some of the second line dunes. 4 to 5 ft of sand covered Johnson Beach road with damage to the road itself. Noaa aerial imagery indicates that 3 new cuts were created on the far east side of Johnson Beach. The surge along the Gulf side of Perdido Key was also significant (7-9 feet) as the water line encroached upon the entrance of some of the condos and damaged walkways and pools. The copious amounts of rain (15-30 inches) also compounded the storm surge issue as water that normally would drain into area bays, rivers, creeks, and streams had nowhere to go due to the incoming storm surge. Downtown Pensacola was one notable area hard hit by this fresh water flooding, but countless other locations, especially across central and southern Escambia county, were also hard hit by this flooding. There were 3 reported fatalities, two direct and one indirect. One person died while trying to retrieve a boat during the storm and another person died while kayaking during the storm. One person died after the storm due to carbon monoxide from a generator being run indoors.||Santa Rosa County, FL: A large storm surge had its greatest impact on the sound and bay|sides of Santa Rosa county. The largest surge occurred in the northern half of Escambia Bay as well as in Blackwater and East Bay. Peak surge inundation reached 7 to 9 feet above ground level. Numerous homes suffered significant inundation from the surge. The surge flooding was compounded by 20+ inches of rain that fell which also resulted in significant to major flash flooding and river flooding. Hurricane force wind gusts also resulted in roof and siding damage to many homes, extensive downed trees, and power lines. To date, around 1,400 residential structures have been identified as being impacted with 6 being destroyed and 139 suffering major damage. 19 commercial buildings have been documented as being impacted with major damage to 4 buildings. ||Okaloosa County, FL: A long duration of tropical storm force winds impacted Okaloosa County as the center of Hurricane Sally tracked very slowly to the east and north of the county. Significant storm surge impacted coastal areas, especially in western parts of Okaloosa county closer to the Santa Rosa line. Many homes on the sound side of the Mary Esther area were inundated by the surge flooding. Portions of Highway 98 on Okaloosa Island were breached by the surge flooding, however the road was not damaged. A 2 ft seawall was breached in Ft. Walton Beach with 2 to 3 ft of water covered adjacent portions of Highway 98. Walkovers and beach side docks were displaced on the Gulf side. A few restaurants and homes suffered some flooding along Calhoun avenue, likely from a combination of the torrential rainfall and storm surge. The copious rainfall also resulted in flash flooding and major river flooding, which also flooded homes in the county.||Escambia County, AL:|Widespread trees were downed throughout Escambia county, AL. Some of the trees fell onto homes, but most of the damage was minor. However, 4 homes suffered major damage from the fallen trees. At the peak of the event, 85% of the county was without power. Torrential rainfall|of 10 to 20 inches led to flash flooding and river flooding, resulting in the 10 county roads becoming impassable during the storm. Some of the roads suffered wash outs. A couple of bridges experienced wash outs as well.||Covington County, AL:|Five homes suffered wind damage as tropical storm force winds impacted Covington county. Trees and power lines were downed which resulted in some power outages. Numerous roads were flooded and impassable. Several roads also suffered wash outs due to the extensive flooding.|||Crenshaw County, AL: Tropical storm force wind gusts downed some trees and power lines in|the county. Significant flooding also occurred, especially in the southern half of the county. Numerous roads were impassable and some experienced washouts.||Monroe County, AL: Tropical storm conditions downed numerous trees and power lines|across Monroe county.||Clarke County, AL:  Tropical storm force winds downed trees across Clarke county. One tree|fell onto a home in Grove Hill, resulting in significant damage.||Conecuh County, AL: Tropical storm force winds downed trees and power lines in Conecuh|County.||Butler County, AL:  Tropical storm conditions downed trees and power lines across portions of Butler county.

A 3 to 4 foot storm surge on the north side of the island resulted in major damage to docks and piers, including at the Dauphin Island marina. Across mainland Mobile county, the southern and central portions of the county experienced a long duration of sustained tropical storm force winds with hurricane force wind gusts recorded all the way west at the Mobile Regional Airport. In fact, the 82 mph gust recorded at the airport was almost as high as the peak gust recorded in Hurricane Katrina of 83 mph. Numerous trees and power lines were downed across the county, especially in central and southern parts of the county. This resulted in widespread power outages. Mobile's Bienville Square suffered major damage to the numerous oaks in the area and there was minor damage reported at some businesses in downtown Mobile. Several homes in the county also experienced roof, siding, and fence damage. Downed trees also damaged some homes. ||Baldwin County AL: The county experienced widespread damage as the eye of Sally moved across a large portion of the county after making landfall in Gulf Shores, AL. A large|storm surge resulted in widespread inundation and major flood damage to structures along the back bay waters with little to no structural damage to buildings along the Gulf facing beaches. There was a walkway at the Cotton Bayou Gulf access that was damaged. The greatest surge occurred east of Gulf Shores across Orange Beach to the Florida State line and all the way north into the northern portion of Perdido Bay, as well as Wolf Bay. Peak inundation was surveyed to be 7 to 9 feet above ground with a much larger area that experienced 3 to 6 feet of inundation. Surge values neared 10 feet above ground at the far western end of Cotton Bayou in Orange Beach. Numerous large boats were moved onto land by the surge. Almost all piers were destroyed and several marinas were heavily damaged. The Gulf State Park Pier in Gulf Shores was also majorly damaged with a large section of the pier now missing. The 20 to 30 inches of rain that fell across the southern part of the county certainly compounded the storm surge flooding and also resulted in widespread flash flooding and river flooding. The Fish and Styx Rivers reached major flood stage and experienced their third and second highest crests respectively. The eyewall of Sally resulted in widespread and extensive damage to trees and power lines. Most of southern Baldwin county experienced sustained hurricane force winds of 75 to 85 mph with gusts over 100 mph. A sailboat anchored in Ingram Bayou measured a 1 minute sustained wind of 113 mph with a gust to 137 mph. These measurements were recorded at an elevated 58 feet. When reduced to the standard measuring height 33 feet, the sustained wind is estimated to have been 104 mph with a gust to 126 mph. The Center of Severe Weather Research recorded a 123 mph gust on the east side of the Perdido Pass bridge from an anemometer on their mobile doppler radar unit with sustained winds of 93 mph. Numerous structures were damaged by fallen trees and many structures in the county suffered significant roof and siding damage. In Ft. Morgan, a few older homes were destroyed and a boat storage facility at a marina suffered major damage. Almost all of the county lost power during the storm due to substantial damage to the power infrastructure. The pecan farming industry took a devastating hit as likely over a thousand pecan trees were destroyed across the county. There were three fatalities from the storm, one direct and two indirect. A person drowned in Orange Beach during the storm. Another fatality occurred in Foley during the post storm clean up and another individual died due to carbon monoxide poisoning from a generator.||Escambia County FL: A combination of strong wind and storm surge resulted in widespread damage to Escambia County. To date, 1,756 structures were damaged. 44 structures were destroyed and 629 suffered major damage. Hurricane force winds resulted in siding and roof damage to many structures, with downed trees also playing a large role in damage to some|structures. Power outages were widespread. Pensacola NAS recorded sustained hurricane force winds with gusts of 92 mph. A large storm surge impacted the county, with the highest surge occurring in the Perdido Key area and along portions of Pensacola and Escambia Bays. Peak inundation of 7 to 9 feet above ground level was surveyed across the northern portions of Pensacola, Escambia, and Blackwater Bays. The tidal gauge at the Port of Pensacola measured an inundation of 5.6 feet, the third highest surge ever recorded (Ivan and the 1926 hurricane are #1 and #2.) Numerous structures had significant damage from storm surge inundation. Numerous large boats and barges were moved onto land by the surge. A portion of the Three Mile bridge across Pensacola Bay collapsed due to damage from the barges. The vast majority of the storm surge structural damage occurred along the back bays and sounds and not along the immediate Gulf facing beaches. However, significant damage occurred along the Gulf islands national seashore, particularly in the Johnson Beach and Ft. Pickens area. On Johnson Beach, the surge and wave action took out a large portion of the first line of dunes with damage even noted to some of the second line dunes. 4 to 5 ft of sand covered Johnson Beach road with damage to the road itself. Noaa aerial imagery indicates that 3 new cuts were created on the far east side of Johnson Beach. The surge along the Gulf side of Perdido Key was also significant (7-9 feet) as the water line encroached upon the entrance of some of the condos and damaged walkways and pools. The copious amounts of rain (15-30 inches) also compounded the storm surge issue as water that normally would drain into area bays, rivers, creeks, and streams had nowhere to go due to the incoming storm surge. Downtown Pensacola was one notable area hard hit by this fresh water flooding, but countless other locations, especially across central and southern Escambia county, were also hard hit by this flooding. There were 3 reported fatalities, two direct and one indirect. One person died while trying to retrieve a boat during the storm and another person died while kayaking during the storm. One person died after the storm due to carbon monoxide from a generator being run indoors.||Santa Rosa County, FL: A large storm surge had its greatest impact on the sound and bay|sides of Santa Rosa county. The largest surge occurred in the northern half of Escambia Bay as well as in Blackwater and East Bay. Peak surge inundation reached 7 to 9 feet above ground level. Numerous homes suffered significant inundation from the surge. The surge flooding was compounded by 20+ inches of rain that fell which also resulted in significant to major flash flooding and river flooding. Hurricane force wind gusts also resulted in roof and siding damage to many homes, extensive downed trees, and power lines. To date, around 1,400 residential structures have been identified as being impacted with 6 being destroyed and 139 suffering major damage. 19 commercial buildings have been documented as being impacted with major damage to 4 buildings. ||Okaloosa County, FL: A long duration of tropical storm force winds impacted Okaloosa County as the center of Hurricane Sally tracked very slowly to the east and north of the county. Significant storm surge impacted coastal areas, especially in western parts of Okaloosa county closer to the Santa Rosa line. Many homes on the sound side of the Mary Esther area were inundated by the surge flooding. Portions of Highway 98 on Okaloosa Island were breached by the surge flooding, however the road was not damaged. A 2 ft seawall was breached in Ft. Walton Beach with 2 to 3 ft of water covered adjacent portions of Highway 98. Walkovers and beach side docks were displaced on the Gulf side. A few restaurants and homes suffered some flooding along Calhoun avenue, likely from a combination of the torrential rainfall and storm surge. The copious rainfall also resulted in flash flooding and major river flooding, which also flooded homes in the county.||Escambia County, AL:|Widespread trees were downed throughout Escambia county, AL. Some of the trees fell onto homes, but most of the damage was minor. However, 4 homes suffered major damage from the fallen trees. At the peak of the event, 85% of the county was without power. Torrential rainfall|of 10 to 20 inches led to flash flooding and river flooding, resulting in the 10 county roads becoming impassable during the storm. Some of the roads suffered wash outs. A couple of bridges experienced wash outs as well.||Covington County, AL:|Five homes suffered wind damage as tropical storm force winds impacted Covington county. Trees and power lines were downed which resulted in some power outages. Numerous roads were flooded and impassable. Several roads also suffered wash outs due to the extensive flooding.|||Crenshaw County, AL: Tropical storm force wind gusts downed some trees and power lines in|the county. Significant flooding also occurred, especially in the southern half of the county. Numerous roads were impassable and some experienced washouts.||Monroe County, AL: Tropical storm conditions downed numerous trees and power lines|across Monroe county.||Clarke County, AL:  Tropical storm force winds downed trees across Clarke county. One tree|fell onto a home in Grove Hill, resulting in significant damage.||Conecuh County, AL: Tropical storm force winds downed trees and power lines in Conecuh|County.||Butler County, AL:  Tropical storm conditions downed trees and power lines across portions of Butler county. A few homes suffered minor damage from fallen trees. Scattered power outages were reported. A few roads were flooded from heavy rain.",249

Zeta quickly raced northeast and moved across inland southeast Mississippi and inland southwest Alabama during the evening hours. Shortly after midnight, Thursday, October 29th, Zeta weakened to a tropical storm while moving across central Alabama. Since Zeta was moving at a rapid 25-30 mph across the area, it brought frequent hurricane force wind gusts and extensive wind damage to inland southeast Mississippi and inland southwest Alabama. Hurricane force gusts extended as far east as coastal Alabama, which contributed to a significant storm surge that impacted portions of Mobile and Baldwin Counties. Sustained minimal tropical storm force winds extended as far east as portions of the western Florida Panhandle.   ||Widespread tree and power line damage was reported across inland southeast Mississippi into inland southwest Alabama as these areas experienced sustained moderate to strong tropical storm force winds and frequent hurricane force wind gusts. Despite a lack of observations, peak gusts of 80 to 100 mph very likely occurred. In fact, the Mobile Regional Airport measured the highest wind gust in the local area of 91 mph. A station in Grove Hill measured a peak gust of 80 mph. Several counties in this area experienced near or 100% power outages. Many homes also suffered minor roof damage, with numerous homes suffering moderate to major damage, many of which were the result of trees falling onto homes.||The highest storm surge occurred in Mobile Bay, along the immediate shores of Baldwin County, as well as southern Mobile County along the Mississippi Sound, as well as Dauphin Island. Peak storm surge inundation was surveyed to be 7 to 9 feet across parts of Bayou La Batre and Coden, as well as the Baldwin County side of Mobile Bay from the Mobile Bay Causeway to south of Point Clear. A few isolated areas approached 10 feet. These higher water levels are a combination of storm surge and wave action. ||Flooding reports were isolated as the fast movement of the storm precluded excessive rainfall amounts. Rainfall totals of 3 to 6 inches were reported along and just to the right of the center across inland southeast Mississippi into inland southwest Alabama.  ||At the time of publication, there was not enough data available to calculate an estimate to storm total monetary damages. ||Here is a breakdown of the county impacts:||Stone County MS: The county experienced sustained tropical storm force winds with gusts of 80-100 mph, which resulted in significant tree and power line damage.

Sustained minimal tropical storm force winds extended as far east as portions of the western Florida Panhandle.   ||Widespread tree and power line damage was reported across inland southeast Mississippi into inland southwest Alabama as these areas experienced sustained moderate to strong tropical storm force winds and frequent hurricane force wind gusts. Despite a lack of observations, peak gusts of 80 to 100 mph very likely occurred. In fact, the Mobile Regional Airport measured the highest wind gust in the local area of 91 mph. A station in Grove Hill measured a peak gust of 80 mph. Several counties in this area experienced near or 100% power outages. Many homes also suffered minor roof damage, with numerous homes suffering moderate to major damage, many of which were the result of trees falling onto homes.||The highest storm surge occurred in Mobile Bay, along the immediate shores of Baldwin County, as well as southern Mobile County along the Mississippi Sound, as well as Dauphin Island. Peak storm surge inundation was surveyed to be 7 to 9 feet across parts of Bayou La Batre and Coden, as well as the Baldwin County side of Mobile Bay from the Mobile Bay Causeway to south of Point Clear. A few isolated areas approached 10 feet. These higher water levels are a combination of storm surge and wave action. ||Flooding reports were isolated as the fast movement of the storm precluded excessive rainfall amounts. Rainfall totals of 3 to 6 inches were reported along and just to the right of the center across inland southeast Mississippi into inland southwest Alabama.  ||At the time of publication, there was not enough data available to calculate an estimate to storm total monetary damages. ||Here is a breakdown of the county impacts:||Stone County MS: The county experienced sustained tropical storm force winds with gusts of 80-100 mph, which resulted in significant tree and power line damage.

Ida made landfall across southeast Louisiana during the late morning on August 29th. Ida turned north and northeast across central Mississippi during late afternoon and evening on Monday, August 30th. ||The core of the hurricane force winds was relatively small, only extending out from the center about 50 miles. However tropical storm force winds extended outward over 150 miles from the center. This brought tropical storm force wind gusts to southeast Mississippi and much of southwest Alabama, with a brief period of sustained tropical storm force winds to coastal Alabama. Wind gusts of 40 to 60 mph were recorded  across southeast Mississippi and southwestern Alabama. The tropical storm force winds also downed several trees across the area.||The highest storm surge inundation values observed were between 3 to 4.5 feet MHHW across southern Mobile county up into the far north end of Mobile Bay. Storm surge surveys indicated the highest water levels were in the Bayou La Batre area along and near Shell Belt Road where peak water levels were in the 4 to 4.5 feet MHHW range. ||The slow movement of the storm caused widespread flooding especially across southeast Mississippi and portions of southwest Alabama. Rainfall amounts of anywhere from 7 to 12 inches were recorded across southeast Mississippi and portions of southwest Alabama. This led to significant flash flooding along with significant river flooding.||Two tornadoes during the afternoon on August 30th. An EF-1 in northern Mobile County and an EF-1 in southern Clarke County.||Here is a breakdown of county impacts:||Stone County MS: Tropical storm force wind gusts downed several trees in Stone|County. Seven to ten inches of rain was recorded and one road had to be barricaded due to flooding. The low lying red creek and mill creek areas experienced flooding, impacting two RV parks.||George County MS: Eight to twelve inches of rain fell across George county which|resulted in significant flash flooding. A portion of Highway 26 collapsed just west of Lucedale, killing three people and injuring seven others. Eleven other roads were significantly flooded and had some form of washout or damage.||Mobile County AL: The west end of Dauphin Island was significantly impacted by Ida|from a combination of high surf, storm surge, and tropical storm force winds. Three miles of Bienville boulevard was impassable due to surge flooding and sand up to four feet deep. The high surf also produced minor damage to a few homes on the west end. Power poles were also knocked down on the island. Storm surge inundation peaked|between 3 and 4.5 feet MHHW across southern Mobile county up into the far north end of Mobile Bay. The highest tidal gauge readings were 3.78 feet MHHW at Coast Guard sector Mobile and 3.82 feet MHHW at the Bayou La Batre bridge. Storm surge surveys along Shell Belt road in Bayou La Batre indicated water lines that reached between 4-4.5 feet.||This surge flooding resulted in closures of low lying coastal roads, such as Shell Belt road, the US Highway 90 causeway, the foot of the Dog river bridge, and the Dauphin Island causeway. Coastal flooding persisted across three high tide cycles which resulted in prolonged closures. Observations at Dauphin Island and Buccaneer Yacht Club on|Mobile Bay measured brief sustained periods of tropical storm force winds between 40-45 mph. Gusts of 50 to 60 mph were recorded in heavier rain bands across central and southern Mobile county. An EF-1 tornado impacted parts of Saraland, Satsuma, and Creola early in the afternoon on August 30th, resulting in three injuries. Rainfall|totals of 8 to 11 inches were recorded across the county, especially in southern and central portions. This heavy rainfall led to some urban flooding in neighborhoods and damaged some drainage culverts.||Baldwin County AL: Storm surge inundation of 3 to 4 feet above normally dry ground was recorded from Weeks Bay northward. This resulted in flooding of low lying areas and closure of the US Highway 90 Causeway. Five to nine inches of rain was measured across Baldwin county, which resulted in areas of flash flooding. A portion of River Road along Styx River was washed out due to heavy rainfall and flooding. A few drainage culverts were also significant damaged in the county. Tropical storm conditions were confined primarily to immediate coastal areas, particularly along the Fort Morgan peninsula.||Clarke County AL: An EF-1 Tornado impacted portions of southern Clarke County, significantly damaging a couple of structures.||Escambia County FL: High surf of at least ten feet resulted in significant flooding and sand on coastal roadways along the Gulf Islands National Seashore. Portions of the road and access areas were closed for an extended period of time.||Santa Rosa County FL: High surf of at least ten feet resulted in significant flooding and sand along the Gulf Islands National Seashore. Portions of the road and access areas were closed for and extended period of time.||Okaloosa County FL: Strong rip currents produced by Ida resulted in two rip current fatalities in the wake of the storm.

The tropical storm force winds also downed several trees across the area.||The highest storm surge inundation values observed were between 3 to 4.5 feet MHHW across southern Mobile county up into the far north end of Mobile Bay. Storm surge surveys indicated the highest water levels were in the Bayou La Batre area along and near Shell Belt Road where peak water levels were in the 4 to 4.5 feet MHHW range. ||The slow movement of the storm caused widespread flooding especially across southeast Mississippi and portions of southwest Alabama. Rainfall amounts of anywhere from 7 to 12 inches were recorded across southeast Mississippi and portions of southwest Alabama. This led to significant flash flooding along with significant river flooding.||Two tornadoes during the afternoon on August 30th. An EF-1 in northern Mobile County and an EF-1 in southern Clarke County.||Here is a breakdown of county impacts:||Stone County MS: Tropical storm force wind gusts downed several trees in Stone|County. Seven to ten inches of rain was recorded and one road had to be barricaded due to flooding. The low lying red creek and mill creek areas experienced flooding, impacting two RV parks.||George County MS: Eight to twelve inches of rain fell across George county which|resulted in significant flash flooding. A portion of Highway 26 collapsed just west of Lucedale, killing three people and injuring seven others. Eleven other roads were significantly flooded and had some form of washout or damage.||Mobile County AL: The west end of Dauphin Island was significantly impacted by Ida|from a combination of high surf, storm surge, and tropical storm force winds. Three miles of Bienville boulevard was impassable due to surge flooding and sand up to four feet deep. The high surf also produced minor damage to a few homes on the west end. Power poles were also knocked down on the island. Storm surge inundation peaked|between 3 and 4.5 feet MHHW across southern Mobile county up into the far north end of Mobile Bay. The highest tidal gauge readings were 3.78 feet MHHW at Coast Guard sector Mobile and 3.82 feet MHHW at the Bayou La Batre bridge. Storm surge surveys along Shell Belt road in Bayou La Batre indicated water lines that reached between 4-4.5 feet.||This surge flooding resulted in closures of low lying coastal roads, such as Shell Belt road, the US Highway 90 causeway, the foot of the Dog river bridge, and the Dauphin Island causeway. Coastal flooding persisted across three high tide cycles which resulted in prolonged closures. Observations at Dauphin Island and Buccaneer Yacht Club on|Mobile Bay measured brief sustained periods of tropical storm force winds between 40-45 mph. Gusts of 50 to 60 mph were recorded in heavier rain bands across central and southern Mobile county. An EF-1 tornado impacted parts of Saraland, Satsuma, and Creola early in the afternoon on August 30th, resulting in three injuries. Rainfall|totals of 8 to 11 inches were recorded across the county, especially in southern and central portions. This heavy rainfall led to some urban flooding in neighborhoods and damaged some drainage culverts.||Baldwin County AL: Storm surge inundation of 3 to 4 feet above normally dry ground was recorded from Weeks Bay northward. This resulted in flooding of low lying areas and closure of the US Highway 90 Causeway. Five to nine inches of rain was measured across Baldwin county, which resulted in areas of flash flooding. A portion of River Road along Styx River was washed out due to heavy rainfall and flooding. A few drainage culverts were also significant damaged in the county. Tropical storm conditions were confined primarily to immediate coastal areas, particularly along the Fort Morgan peninsula.||Clarke County AL: An EF-1 Tornado impacted portions of southern Clarke County, significantly damaging a couple of structures.||Escambia County FL: High surf of at least ten feet resulted in significant flooding and sand on coastal roadways along the Gulf Islands National Seashore. Portions of the road and access areas were closed for an extended period of time.||Santa Rosa County FL: High surf of at least ten feet resulted in significant flooding and sand along the Gulf Islands National Seashore. Portions of the road and access areas were closed for and extended period of time.||Okaloosa County FL: Strong rip currents produced by Ida resulted in two rip current fatalities in the wake of the storm. One occurred on September 1st when a 14 year old teen drowned off a Destin Beach. The other fatality occurred on September 4th when a 58 year old man drowned off Henderson Beach State Park.",306
