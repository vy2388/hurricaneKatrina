Rainbands on the outer edge of the hurricane began to affect the Washington D.C. area shortly after 8:00 AM EDT on the 15th and continued to cross the area through afternoon on the 16th.  The eye of Hurricane Floyd passed east of the Chesapeake Bay between 9:00 AM and midnight on the 16th.  Gusty winds of 40 to 60 MPH blew across the District between 11:00 AM and midnight on the 16th.  Children's Hospital reported a wind gust of 56 MPH at 2:13 PM EDT, and Washington National Airport recorded a gust of 55 MPH at 3:00 PM EDT.  Two hundred downed trees blocked roads and damaged houses and cars.  Downed power lines resulted in 7000 electrical outages.  Four schools remained without power through the 18th. Up to 6 inches of rain fell across the city. High water closed Independence Avenue from 15th to 23rd Street. Rock Creek Parkway was closed from Virginia Avenue to Calvert Street.  At 1:45 PM EDT on the 16th, a vacant building in the 600 block of New York Avenue collapsed from rain accumulated on its roof.  Rainfall totals included 6.00 inches at Foggy Bottom, 5.57 inches in Upper Northwest, 5.39 inches at Children's Hospital, and 4.57 inches at National Airport.",1

The city had days of preparation and many people including non-emergency government personnel were told to stay home. Tropical storm force winds spread north into the area by 4 pm. Because air temperatures were cool (in the 60s) and the peak of the storm occurred near midnight, the real hurricane force winds were a few hundred feet up. Wind sensors on building tops recorded 70 to 85 mph hour winds. At the surface, winds were about half of that, but occasional strong gusts would mix down from above and damage trees and power lines. Winds began to subside falling below tropical storm by 4 am after the storm's passage west of the city, but remained gusty through the morning. Over 700 trees were blown down in the city with 23 falling on homes. The U.S. National Arboretum lost many mature trees. During the peak of the storm up to 129,000 customers lost power. 

As the storm's winds peaked near midnight with wind gusts of 55 to 65 mph from a more southerly direction, Isabel's storm surge began. Flooding began around midnight as water pushed up both the Potomac and the Anacostia Rivers. The surge crested around 5 am and receded below flood stage around 10 am with the southerly winds dying off.  All flooding was tidal related since only two inches of rain fell across the district during the storm.  The NWS gauge at Wisconsin Avenue measured 11.3 feet (MLW) at 5:15 am. This was 0.2 feet higher than the reading during the 1933 hurricane (however, sea level has risen since 1933 by at least this much). The NOS gauge at the pier in SW DC recorded a peak surge of 10.25 feet (MLLW) or 8.7 feet MSL at around 5 am. This was also higher than the 1933 storm. This makes Isabel the record tidal flood at these locations, but downstream freshwater flooding has caused higher river levels at each of these points.  While sandbagging and other preparations mitigated against a lot of potential damage, damages were still high. At Naval District Washington along the Anacostia, marinas were damaged and cars left in low area garages were flooded. Some buildings were flooded. Coast Guard Headquarters had water come into several levels of the building causing serious damage. Other marinas water front properties and parks were damaged and had a lot of debris and cleanup to do. The U.S National Arboretum lost many of its 12,000 azaleas located along the bank of the Anacostia. Five people were rescued from cars in flood waters during the storm. Park Police had to close the roads around the tidal basin, the mall, and near Rock Creek. 

Total damages for the District are estimated to combine damages to private and public property which in this case includes a lot of federal property and National Park land.",2

Over 30,000 people lost power. Several Row Houses received extensive damage and were deemed uninhabitable. Several trees fell onto single family homes and a few cars were crushed by fallen trees. Numerous roadways were blocked by downed trees.","Hurricane Irene tracked up the Mid-Atlantic Coast during the evening hours of the 27th through the early morning hours of the 28th. Irene passed by just to the east of Ocean City, Maryland during the early morning hours of the 28th. The minimum central pressure was 958 millibars and maximum sustained winds were 80 mph, making Irene a category one hurricane. Irene produced tropical storm conditions across Washington DC during the afternoon hours of the 27th and lasting into the early morning hours of the 28th. ||The highest rainfall total was 4.44 inches at the National Arboretum. Numerous trees and power lines were down causing an estimated 2.4 million dollars in damage.",3
