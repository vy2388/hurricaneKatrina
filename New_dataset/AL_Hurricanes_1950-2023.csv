The center of the storm moved across Fort Morgan and into Mobile Bay during the early morning hours on Saturday. The storm remained nearly stationary over Mobile Bay for  eight hours.  Danny then creeped east, making landfall at Mullet Point, near Weeks Bay during the afternoon.  The storm continued moving slowly east across Baldwin county reaching Orange Beach during the evening.  Danny then drifted north along the Alabama and Florida border,  weakening to a depression near Walnut Hill Florida late Sunday morning.  Danny continued to drift north and passed through and out of Clarke county during the day Monday.  
Torrential rainfall fell generally along and south of I-10 in Mobile and Baldwin counties and throughout the central and south parts of Choctaw county.  The heaviest convection around Danny  shifted from the east to the west side of the storm while the center was over Mobile Bay. WSR-88D estimated an incredible 43 inches of  storm total rain over the open water in Mobile Bay.  Observing sites reported from 30 to 40 inches across the area with Dauphin Island reporting 36.71 inches with 25.98 inches of this falling between 5 PM and midnight on Saturday.  Unofficial estimates of 35 to 40 inches of rainfall were reported near the center of Danny as the storm moved across Weeks Bay.  As a result of the deluge, numerous roads were inundated and impassable for days. Record flooding caused major damage to homes along the Fowl River in Mobile county and the Fish river in Baldwin county.  A gauge site on the Fowl river at Laurendine Road recorded a height of 12.6 feet which is 1.5 times higher than the 100 year flood. At a gauge site on the Fish River near Silverhill a height of 22.8 feet was recorded, making this a 50 year flood event.  However, residents who have lived along the lower half of the Fish River for years, said this was the highest they had ever seen the river.  One reason for this,  was the heaviest rains fell south of the Silverhill gauging site.  More than 100 people had to be evacuated from their homes on Sunday as the Fish River overflowed its banks.  In Mobile county...Most of the roads on Dauphin Island were covered with more than a foot of water.  A CSX railroad trestle was undermined by flooding and collapsed at US HWY 90 and Ramsey Road.  In Baldwin county...numerous roads south of US HWY 98 and along roads near the Fish River were inundated and impassable for days.  
It was estimated that 80 percent of the Alabama public oyster reefs in Mobile county and 60 percent of the reefs in Baldwin county were destroyed and will take approximately 2 years to rebuild.  
Along the eastern shore, from Fairhope to Spanish Fort, heavy rains caused land slides and a few homes were teetering on the edge of Mobile Bay.  One home had to be relocated away from the edge of the Bay to prevent loss.  A 300 foot long sediment blockage, standing 6 feet high and 2 feet below the water, marooned up to 350 boats along the eastern shore marina slips.  For some of the marinas, the channels had to be redredged before boats could move in and out.   
On the east end of Dauphin Island, highest wind gusts were reported just over 100 mph with sustained winds of 70 to 80 mph. While inland at Mobile Regional Airport,  winds gusted to 45 mph with sustained winds of 35 mph.  Wind gusts from Fort Morgan to Orange Beach were estimated at 80 to 100 mph.  Most homes and businesses on Dauphin Island and buildings along the western shore of Mobile Bay and homes from Fort Morgan east to Orange Beach sustained some type of roof damage.  Many homes in this area, with Gabled roofs, also suffered water damage as persistent winds blew rain into the attic through the vents in the ends of the homes.  A multi-story condominium under construction, near Gulf State Park in Gulf Shores, collapsed.  Numerous pecan and pine trees were blown over in the coastal areas of southwest Alabama with most extensive damage being in Baldwin county from Fairhope to Weeks Bay.  It was estimated that 70 percent of the Mobile pecan crop and 60 percent of the Baldwin crop for 1997 was lost.  High winds caused a  ferry, docked at Fort Gaines, to break away from its moorings on Saturday morning.  The runaway ferry destroyed the catwalk from the Dauphin Island weather observation platform.  The ferry wandered through the entrance of Mobile Bay coming to rest in a marsh near Gulf Shores.  
The state docks on the Mobile River recorded a low tide of -2 feet.  Most of the water was blown out by the storm Saturday morning for several hours. People observing the bay said they had never seen it so low.  Except for the river channels, you could have walked across the bay.  A storm surge height of 5 feet was recorded in Dauphin Island Bay.  A storm surge of 2.4 feet was recorded along the south shores of Dauphin Island and also near Bayou La Batre with the highest surge being 6.5 feet in Baldwin county along HWY 182, halfway between Fort Morgan and Gulf Shores.  Six feet of salt water was inside the historical 163 year old Fort Morgan.  Three turn of the century homes, on Fort Morgan, only sustained roof damage.  
Although Danny was downgraded to a depression Sunday morning at 1000 am, the slow northward movement caused extensive flooding across most of Choctaw county on Monday and Tuesday.  Rainfall totals of around 15 inches caused most streams in the county to come out of their banks.  The heavy rains also caused extensive flooding of roads, from Lisman to Butler south to near Gilbertown.
Except for some damage to the cotton crop in Escambia county Florida, Danny caused very little damage in Northwest Florida. 
One 41 year old male was killed as a result of the storm.  He was on his way to St. Thomas Island in a wooden sailboat with his dog.  He was trying to evacuate ahead of Danny when high winds blew him overboard.  He was found in the surf, near Gulf Shores.  His dog was found roaming the beach several days later and returned to relatives.  An elderly male fell victim to the storm, indirectly, suffering a heart attack as he was going to secure his boat in Baldwin county.",1

Hurricane Georges affected the region September 25 through the 29.  The coastal areas from Dauphin Island to east of Destin were put under a hurricane watch at 900 AM CST, September 25.  A hurricane warning was issued for the area at 900 AM CST, September 26.  The hurricane warning was changed to a tropical storm warning for the area at 300 PM CST, September 28.  All tropical storm warnings for the area were dropped at 900 AM CST, September 29.
Georges made landfall along the Mississippi coast near Biloxi between 300 and 500 AM CST, September 28.
Some of the winds recorded across Southwest Alabama and Northwest Florida were as follows: Mobile Regional Airport, sustained winds of 44 knots, gusts to 55 knots.  Pensacola Regional Airport, sustained winds of 44 knots, gusts to 58 knots.  Pensacola Naval Air Station, sustained winds of 40 knots, gusts 61 knots.  Hurlburt Air Force Base in Mary Esther, sustained winds of 44 knots, gusts to 69 knots.  Eglin Air Force Base in Valparaiso, sustained winds of 42 knots, gusts to 79 knots.  Dauphin Island C-Man Buoy, gusts to 71 knots.
Lowest sea level pressure was 989.9 millibars at Mobile Regional Airport.
Four day rainfall totals ending around midnight on September 29: Mobile Regional Airport 15.02 inches,  Pensacola Regional Airport 15.78 inches, Crestview 19.98 inches, Valparaiso 24.24 inches, Pensacola Naval Air Station 12.84 inches, Milton (Whiting Field) 18.41 inches, Bay Minette 29.66 inches, Andalusia (TV Station) 26.90 inches, Pensacola (TV Station) 26.83 inches, Gulf Breeze 26.87 inches and Spanish Fort 19.86 inches.
Most of the destruction along the coastal areas was caused by a very high storm surge.  Surges along the coast were estimated at 7 to 12 feet in Mobile and Baldwin counties and 5 to 10 feet in Escambia, Santa Rosa and Okaloosa counties in Northwest Florida.  Downtown Mobile had a surge of around 8.5 feet, with high "water" covering Water street.  Bayou La Batre had a surge of 8.8 feet and many businesses and homes had water in them.  The western part of Mobile Bay had a surge of 8.3 feet and the road parallel to the bay near Nan Seas was completely washed out.  Along the Mobile Bay Causeway the surge was 8.0 feet.  A male clung to a tree along the Causeway for almost twenty-four hours to escape the high water.  He was staying in a building that the high surge destroyed and took refuge in a tree.  He was able to tread to another building after the water retreated and was found the next day, exhausted.  Many businesses along the Causeway were damaged by the surge.  Fort Morgan had a surge of 8.5 feet with Gulf Shores having 9.0 feet.  The surge on the west end of Dauphin Island caused the most damage where eighty homes were damaged with around forty completely destroyed.  Many gulf front homes on the west end of the island were pushed across the island and ended up either against other homes or scattered across the sand.  Pensacola Beach had a surge of 7.7 feet with Destin Harbour reaching a surge of 5.2 feet.
Major beach erosion occurred along the coast from Dauphin Island to Destin.  High water breached Dauphin Island, Pensacola Beach and Navarre Beach in several locations.  Several motels from Gulf Shores to Destin suffered major damage.  Two condominiums were heavily damaged in Orange Beach, one by fire and the other by high waves.  Some of the motels that suffered damage were still closed two months after the storm.  Sand pushed in by the high water caused several coastal roads to be closed from Dauphin Island to Destin.  Some of the roads were completely washed away with the roads having to be rebuilt on Dauphin Island, Pensacola Beach and Navarre Beach.  Some of the roads were still closed two months after the storm.
Major damage occurred from river flooding in several of the inland counties after Georges dissipated.  The Styx, Perdido, Shoal, Yellow, Big Escambia Creek, Bayou Sara and Blackwater rivers either were near or above record flood levels.  Other rivers from Southeast Mississippi to the Florida Panhandle came out of their banks.
It was estimated that nine tornadoes occurred across the area.  The tornadoes occurred in Baldwin, Covington and Crenshaw counties in Southwest Alabama and in Okaloosa county in Northwest Florida.  
One death was directly related to the hurricane.  In Mobile county a 43 year old female was returning home on the evening of September 27, after checking on her parents who lived just inside the Mississippi line.  She hit a flooded spot in the road and slid off into Franklin Creek and drowned.  She was not found for several days.  In Escambia county Florida, three deaths were indirectly related to Georges.  A female, using a candle for light on September 27, died in a fire caused by the candle.  An elderly couple were both killed in a car accident on September 29.  They were hit at an intersection where the storm had knocked the power off and the stop lights were not working.
Most of the inland counties in Southeast Mississippi and Southwest Alabama had damage from heavy rains and from trees and power lines being blown down by the persistent winds.  One of the hardest hit areas by the high winds was in Stone county Mississippi near where the center of the hurricane moved.  Eighty five homes were damaged in Stone county by the wind.  Fifty four homes had minor damage, twenty six had major damage and five were destroyed.  Most of the damage was along and east of U. S. Highway 49.
Throughout the area, agriculture took a beating with the cotton, soybean and pecan crop almost totally destroyed.
Preliminary damage estimates in Southwest Alabama were 174.2 million dollars, in Northwest Florida 135 million dollars and in Southeast Mississippi 72 million dollars.",10

Hurricane Georges affected the region September 25 through the 29.  The coastal areas from Dauphin Island to east of Destin were put under a hurricane watch at 900 AM CST, September 25.  A hurricane warning was issued for the area at 900 AM CST, September 26.  The hurricane warning was changed to a tropical storm warning for the area at 300 PM CST, September 28.  All tropical storm warnings for the area were dropped at 900 AM CST, September 29.
Georges made landfall along the Mississippi coast near Biloxi between 300 and 500 AM CST, September 28.
Some of the winds recorded across Southwest Alabama and Northwest Florida were as follows: Mobile Regional Airport, sustained winds of 44 knots, gusts to 55 knots.  Pensacola Regional Airport, sustained winds of 44 knots, gusts to 58 knots.  Pensacola Naval Air Station, sustained winds of 40 knots, gusts 61 knots.  Hurlburt Air Force Base in Mary Esther, sustained winds of 44 knots, gusts to 69 knots.  Eglin Air Force Base in Valparaiso, sustained winds of 42 knots, gusts to 79 knots.  Dauphin Island C-Man Buoy, gusts to 71 knots.
Lowest sea level pressure was 989.9 millibars at Mobile Regional Airport.
Four day rainfall totals ending around midnight on September 29: Mobile Regional Airport 15.02 inches,  Pensacola Regional Airport 15.78 inches, Crestview 19.98 inches, Valparaiso 24.24 inches, Pensacola Naval Air Station 12.84 inches, Milton (Whiting Field) 18.41 inches, Bay Minette 29.66 inches, Andalusia (TV Station) 26.90 inches, Pensacola (TV Station) 26.83 inches, Gulf Breeze 26.87 inches and Spanish Fort 19.86 inches.
Most of the destruction along the coastal areas was caused by a very high storm surge.  Surges along the coast were estimated at 7 to 12 feet in Mobile and Baldwin counties and 5 to 10 feet in Escambia, Santa Rosa and Okaloosa counties in Northwest Florida.  Downtown Mobile had a surge of around 8.5 feet, with high "water" covering Water street.  Bayou La Batre had a surge of 8.8 feet and many businesses and homes had water in them.  The western part of Mobile Bay had a surge of 8.3 feet and the road parallel to the bay near Nan Seas was completely washed out.  Along the Mobile Bay Causeway the surge was 8.0 feet.  A male clung to a tree along the Causeway for almost twenty-four hours to escape the high water.  He was staying in a building that the high surge destroyed and took refuge in a tree.  He was able to tread to another building after the water retreated and was found the next day, exhausted.  Many businesses along the Causeway were damaged by the surge.  Fort Morgan had a surge of 8.5 feet with Gulf Shores having 9.0 feet.  The surge on the west end of Dauphin Island caused the most damage where eighty homes were damaged with around forty completely destroyed.  Many gulf front homes on the west end of the island were pushed across the island and ended up either against other homes or scattered across the sand.  Pensacola Beach had a surge of 7.7 feet with Destin Harbour reaching a surge of 5.2 feet.
Major beach erosion occurred along the coast from Dauphin Island to Destin.  High water breached Dauphin Island, Pensacola Beach and Navarre Beach in several locations.  Several motels from Gulf Shores to Destin suffered major damage.  Two condominiums were heavily damaged in Orange Beach, one by fire and the other by high waves.  Some of the motels that suffered damage were still closed two months after the storm.  Sand pushed in by the high water caused several coastal roads to be closed from Dauphin Island to Destin.  Some of the roads were completely washed away with the roads having to be rebuilt on Dauphin Island, Pensacola Beach and Navarre Beach.  Some of the roads were still closed two months after the storm.
Major damage occurred from river flooding in several of the inland counties after Georges dissipated.  The Styx, Perdido, Shoal, Yellow, Big Escambia Creek, Bayou Sara and Blackwater rivers either were near or above record flood levels.  Other rivers from Southeast Mississippi to the Florida Panhandle came out of their banks.
It was estimated that nine tornadoes occurred across the area.  The tornadoes occurred in Baldwin, Covington and Crenshaw counties in Southwest Alabama and in Okaloosa county in Northwest Florida.  
One death was directly related to the hurricane.  In Mobile county a 43 year old female was returning home on the evening of September 27, after checking on her parents who lived just inside the Mississippi line.  She hit a flooded spot in the road and slid off into Franklin Creek and drowned.  She was not found for several days.  In Escambia county Florida, three deaths were indirectly related to Georges.  A female, using a candle for light on September 27, died in a fire caused by the candle.  An elderly couple were both killed in a car accident on September 29.

Four day rainfall totals ending around midnight on September 29: Mobile Regional Airport 15.02 inches,  Pensacola Regional Airport 15.78 inches, Crestview 19.98 inches, Valparaiso 24.24 inches, Pensacola Naval Air Station 12.84 inches, Milton (Whiting Field) 18.41 inches, Bay Minette 29.66 inches, Andalusia (TV Station) 26.90 inches, Pensacola (TV Station) 26.83 inches, Gulf Breeze 26.87 inches and Spanish Fort 19.86 inches.
Most of the destruction along the coastal areas was caused by a very high storm surge.  Surges along the coast were estimated at 7 to 12 feet in Mobile and Baldwin counties and 5 to 10 feet in Escambia, Santa Rosa and Okaloosa counties in Northwest Florida.  Downtown Mobile had a surge of around 8.5 feet, with high "water" covering Water street.  Bayou La Batre had a surge of 8.8 feet and many businesses and homes had water in them.  The western part of Mobile Bay had a surge of 8.3 feet and the road parallel to the bay near Nan Seas was completely washed out.  Along the Mobile Bay Causeway the surge was 8.0 feet.  A male clung to a tree along the Causeway for almost twenty-four hours to escape the high water.  He was staying in a building that the high surge destroyed and took refuge in a tree.  He was able to tread to another building after the water retreated and was found the next day, exhausted.  Many businesses along the Causeway were damaged by the surge.  Fort Morgan had a surge of 8.5 feet with Gulf Shores having 9.0 feet.  The surge on the west end of Dauphin Island caused the most damage where eighty homes were damaged with around forty completely destroyed.  Many gulf front homes on the west end of the island were pushed across the island and ended up either against other homes or scattered across the sand.  Pensacola Beach had a surge of 7.7 feet with Destin Harbour reaching a surge of 5.2 feet.
Major beach erosion occurred along the coast from Dauphin Island to Destin.  High water breached Dauphin Island, Pensacola Beach and Navarre Beach in several locations.  Several motels from Gulf Shores to Destin suffered major damage.  Two condominiums were heavily damaged in Orange Beach, one by fire and the other by high waves.  Some of the motels that suffered damage were still closed two months after the storm.  Sand pushed in by the high water caused several coastal roads to be closed from Dauphin Island to Destin.  Some of the roads were completely washed away with the roads having to be rebuilt on Dauphin Island, Pensacola Beach and Navarre Beach.  Some of the roads were still closed two months after the storm.
Major damage occurred from river flooding in several of the inland counties after Georges dissipated.  The Styx, Perdido, Shoal, Yellow, Big Escambia Creek, Bayou Sara and Blackwater rivers either were near or above record flood levels.  Other rivers from Southeast Mississippi to the Florida Panhandle came out of their banks.
It was estimated that nine tornadoes occurred across the area.  The tornadoes occurred in Baldwin, Covington and Crenshaw counties in Southwest Alabama and in Okaloosa county in Northwest Florida.  
One death was directly related to the hurricane.  In Mobile county a 43 year old female was returning home on the evening of September 27, after checking on her parents who lived just inside the Mississippi line.  She hit a flooded spot in the road and slid off into Franklin Creek and drowned.  She was not found for several days.  In Escambia county Florida, three deaths were indirectly related to Georges.  A female, using a candle for light on September 27, died in a fire caused by the candle.  An elderly couple were both killed in a car accident on September 29.  They were hit at an intersection where the storm had knocked the power off and the stop lights were not working.
Most of the inland counties in Southeast Mississippi and Southwest Alabama had damage from heavy rains and from trees and power lines being blown down by the persistent winds.  One of the hardest hit areas by the high winds was in Stone county Mississippi near where the center of the hurricane moved.  Eighty five homes were damaged in Stone county by the wind.  Fifty four homes had minor damage, twenty six had major damage and five were destroyed.  Most of the damage was along and east of U. S. Highway 49.
Throughout the area, agriculture took a beating with the cotton, soybean and pecan crop almost totally destroyed.
Preliminary damage estimates in Southwest Alabama were 174.2 million dollars, in Northwest Florida 135 million dollars and in Southeast Mississippi 72 million dollars.",20

Storm surge values along the coast from Baldwin county east to Santa Rosa county were the highest observed in over a hundred years of record keeping .  The high surge values of 10 to 14 feet caused extensive damage to homes and condos located along the Gulf beachfront, as well as along the shoreline of area inland waterways.  Dauphin Island had several areas that were breached by the high surge.  There was less damage on Dauphin Island than with Hurricane Frederic in 1979, even with the extensive building that has occurred on the island since 1979.  In Baldwin county, the coastal areas from Fort Morgan to Gulf Shores to Orange Beach saw the worst damage from a hurricane in over a hundred years.  This area has seen rapid development in the past 20 years and it seemed that the homes and condo's constructed in the past five years held up better than homes that were constructed earlier.  Surge values were estimated between nine and twelve feet along the Baldwin county coastline, and the beach was breached at several locations.   No one died as a result of storm surge in Baldwin county.
In Escambia county Florida, surge values were estimated at ten to fourteen feet.  These coastal areas were the hardest hit, with major damage occurring from Perdido Key to Pensacola Beach.  Almost every structure that was on the waterfront in Escambia county suffered some degree of damage.  Generally, if the property elevation was below fifteen feet, water flooded the property.  Property that was on Perdido Bay, Big Lagoon, Bayou Grande, Pensacola Bay and Escambia Bay suffered major damage.  Many homes were completely washed away by the high surge.  Almost all of the deaths directly attributed to Ivan in Escambia County were surge related, and occurred near Big Lagoon.   The beach area from Perdido Key to Pensacola Beach was breached in several places.  Fort Pickens was cut off and isolated from the rest of  Pensacola Beach as a result of several breaches.  The highest surge values observed during the storm were in the upper reaches of Escambia Bay.  The surge, and accompanying wind waves, damaged the I-10 bridge across Escambia Bay.  A trucker died on the bridge when his truck plummeted off a bridge section that had been displaced by the surge. Pensacola Naval Air Station, which is located on Pensacola Bay across from Fort Pickens, suffered major damage to structures that were located on the water.  Many of the structures had been built in the late 1800's, and had been through several other hurricanes with only minor damage.   In Santa Rosa county, surge values were between nine and twelve feet.  Navarre Beach had several breaches, and major damage occurred to almost all structures that were on the Gulf front.   Major damage also occurred along the shores of Gulf Breeze and along Blackwater Bay. Some of the highest surge values in Santa Rosa county were near Ward Basin.  Surge values across most locations east of where the center of the hurricane moved ashore were higher than those of hurricane George in 1998.  As in Escambia county, almost every structure that was on the water in Santa Rosa county suffered some type of damage.  In Okaloosa county surge values were six to nine feet.  Structures that were located on or near the beach suffered major damage.  Farther to the east, storm surge values dropped off, but the wave action essentially destroyed the beach, with four to eight feet of the sand eroded away.  Low lying structures on Choctawatchee Bay also suffered major damage.  US Highway 98 between Fort Walton and Destin was again washed away.  Structures near the beach that were part of Eglin Air Force Base also suffered major damage.
The following surge values were measured in Alabama: Middle Gage at Bayou LaBatre 4.66 feet. Mobile Bay at Cedar Point 6.90 feet. Dauphin Island Bay at Dauphin Island 7.80 feet.  Mobile Bay at Dauphin Island Coast Guard 8.00 feet. Mobile River at Mobile 4.87 feet. Mobile River at Bucks 6.82 feet. Mobile Bay at Fort Morgan Front Range 7.85 feet. Perdido Pass at Orange Beach 8.81 feet.

Destin at Choctawatchee Bay Coast Guard 5.39 feet.
As Ivan moved ashore during the morning hours of September 16th, the winds caused major damage to trees along and east of the track of the storm.  Hurricane force winds were felt across the entire area, including all inland counties.  Most of the area probably had hurricane force winds for two to four hours.  This caused 100 year old trees to break due to the constant force from the strong winds.  Many of the trees fell on homes and vehicles and damaged them.  While some structural wind damage would have been expected, most of the major structural damage that occurred over inland areas would not have been as substantial if it had not been for fallen trees.  It was estimated that in Alabama over $500,000,000 damage was done to timber,  with an additional estimate of $250,000,000 in Escambia, Santa Rosa and Okaloosa counties in Florida.  Power was out for a week or more across the inland areas due to trees across lines.  
Along the immediate coast, power was not restored for an additional several weeks, until much of the infrastructure was rebuilt.
It was estimated that six weak tornadoes occurred across the area during the afternoon and early evening of September 15th as Ivan neared the coast.  These weak tornadoes occurred in Escambia and Santa Rosa counties in Florida, and in Baldwin, Escambia and Conecuh in Alabama and produced only minor damages.   
Seven deaths were directly related to Ivan.  Six of these were in Escambia county with one in Santa Rosa county.  In Escambia county Florida: Five people (three women and two males) drowned at different locations around Grand Lagoon as the surge inundated the area.  A male drowned after his truck ran off the damaged I-10 bridge.   In Santa Rosa county, a young female died when a tree fell on their manufactured home and killed her.  
Sixteen deaths were indirectly related to Ivan.  In Escambia county Florida: A 78 year old female died of a heart attack in a shelter just before Ivan moved ashore.  A 7 year old boy was killed as he was watching someone remove a tree and a large limb fell on him.   A 58 year old  female died when she was overcome by fumes from a generator that was not properly ventilated.  A 41 year old male died in a traffic accident at an intersection with no power and no stop lights.  A 83 year old male fell off a roof while repairing damage from Ivan.  A 63 year old male fell out of a tree in Escambia county Alabama and was taken to a Pensacola hospital where he later died from injuries sustained in the fall.  A 40 year old male died when a tree fell on him.  In Santa Rosa county: A 67 year old male died of a heart attack preparing for Ivan.  A 76 year old male died of a heart attack.  A 56 year old male died of a heart attack cleaning up days after the storm.  In Okaloosa county: A 54 year old female died of a heart attack when emergency crews could not get to her due to the storm.  A 51 year old male died of a heart attack.  A 50 year old female died days after Ivan from a drug overdose due to depression cause by the storm.  
In Covington county a 75 year old female died from a fire caused by a candle used for light after the storm.  In Conecuh county a 34 year old male died from a car accident when he hit debris still in the road from the storm.  In Mobile county a 59 year old male died when a tree fell on him after the storm.
Agriculture interests suffered a major blow from Ivan with most of the soybean and pecan crop destroyed.  The cotton crop also suffered damage but not as bad as that of the soybean and pecan crop.  
Ivan will be remembered as being one of the most damaging hurricanes to affect the coastal counties of Baldwin, Escambia and Santa Rosa in modern history.  It will also be remembered as one of  the most damaging hurricanes to affect the inland counties of Escambia, Clarke, Monroe, Conecuh and Butler  in southwest Alabama.",27

Storm surge values along the coast from Baldwin county east to Santa Rosa county were the highest observed in over a hundred years of record keeping .  The high surge values of 10 to 14 feet caused extensive damage to homes and condos located along the Gulf beachfront, as well as along the shoreline of area inland waterways.  Dauphin Island had several areas that were breached by the high surge.  There was less damage on Dauphin Island than with Hurricane Frederic in 1979, even with the extensive building that has occurred on the island since 1979.  In Baldwin county, the coastal areas from Fort Morgan to Gulf Shores to Orange Beach saw the worst damage from a hurricane in over a hundred years.  This area has seen rapid development in the past 20 years and it seemed that the homes and condo's constructed in the past five years held up better than homes that were constructed earlier.  Surge values were estimated between nine and twelve feet along the Baldwin county coastline, and the beach was breached at several locations.   No one died as a result of storm surge in Baldwin county.

Ivan made landfall around 100 AM CST near Gulf Shores, Alabama on September 16.   An interesting note, as Ivan approached the Alabama coast during the day on the 15th, a buoy just south of the Alabama coastal waters recorded a peak wave height of 52 feet, before breaking loose of its mooring.  This was one of the highest wave heights ever observed.

Storm surge values along the coast from Baldwin county east to Santa Rosa county were the highest observed in over a hundred years of record keeping .  The high surge values of 10 to 14 feet caused extensive damage to homes and condos located along the Gulf beachfront, as well as along the shoreline of area inland waterways.  Dauphin Island had several areas that were breached by the high surge.  There was less damage on Dauphin Island than with Hurricane Frederic in 1979, even with the extensive building that has occurred on the island since 1979.  In Baldwin county, the coastal areas from Fort Morgan to Gulf Shores to Orange Beach saw the worst damage from a hurricane in over a hundred years.  This area has seen rapid development in the past 20 years and it seemed that the homes and condo's constructed in the past five years held up better than homes that were constructed earlier.  Surge values were estimated between nine and twelve feet along the Baldwin county coastline, and the beach was breached at several locations.   No one died as a result of storm surge in Baldwin county.
In Escambia county Florida, surge values were estimated at ten to fourteen feet.  These coastal areas were the hardest hit, with major damage occurring from Perdido Key to Pensacola Beach.  Almost every structure that was on the waterfront in Escambia county suffered some degree of damage.  Generally, if the property elevation was below fifteen feet, water flooded the property.  Property that was on Perdido Bay, Big Lagoon, Bayou Grande, Pensacola Bay and Escambia Bay suffered major damage.  Many homes were completely washed away by the high surge.  Almost all of the deaths directly attributed to Ivan in Escambia County were surge related, and occurred near Big Lagoon.   The beach area from Perdido Key to Pensacola Beach was breached in several places.  Fort Pickens was cut off and isolated from the rest of  Pensacola Beach as a result of several breaches.  The highest surge values observed during the storm were in the upper reaches of Escambia Bay.  The surge, and accompanying wind waves, damaged the I-10 bridge across Escambia Bay.  A trucker died on the bridge when his truck plummeted off a bridge section that had been displaced by the surge. Pensacola Naval Air Station, which is located on Pensacola Bay across from Fort Pickens, suffered major damage to structures that were located on the water.  Many of the structures had been built in the late 1800's, and had been through several other hurricanes with only minor damage.   In Santa Rosa county, surge values were between nine and twelve feet.  Navarre Beach had several breaches, and major damage occurred to almost all structures that were on the Gulf front.   Major damage also occurred along the shores of Gulf Breeze and along Blackwater Bay. Some of the highest surge values in Santa Rosa county were near Ward Basin.  Surge values across most locations east of where the center of the hurricane moved ashore were higher than those of hurricane George in 1998.  As in Escambia county, almost every structure that was on the water in Santa Rosa county suffered some type of damage.  In Okaloosa county surge values were six to nine feet.  Structures that were located on or near the beach suffered major damage.  Farther to the east, storm surge values dropped off, but the wave action essentially destroyed the beach, with four to eight feet of the sand eroded away.  Low lying structures on Choctawatchee Bay also suffered major damage.  US Highway 98 between Fort Walton and Destin was again washed away.  Structures near the beach that were part of Eglin Air Force Base also suffered major damage.
The following surge values were measured in Alabama: Middle Gage at Bayou LaBatre 4.66 feet. Mobile Bay at Cedar Point 6.90 feet. Dauphin Island Bay at Dauphin Island 7.80 feet.  Mobile Bay at Dauphin Island Coast Guard 8.00 feet. Mobile River at Mobile 4.87 feet. Mobile River at Bucks 6.82 feet. Mobile Bay at Fort Morgan Front Range 7.85 feet. Perdido Pass at Orange Beach 8.81 feet.
The following surge values were measured in Northwest Florida; Perdido Bay near US Highway 98 estimated 10.00 feet. GIWW at Pensacola Gulf Beach 9.68 feet. Pensacola Bay at Fort McRee 9.70 feet. Pensacola Bay at Pensacola 10.20 feet. Escambia Bay West Bank at Highway 90 12.92 feet. Escambia Bay West Bank 1.5 miles north of I-10 12.12 feet.  Escambia Bay near Pace estimated 12.00 feet. GIWW at Gulf Breeze 10.30 feet. Pensacola Beach Fire Station estimated 12 feet. Yellow River near Milton 9.66 feet. Fort Walton Brooks Bridge 6.12 feet. Destin at Choctawatchee Bay Coast Guard 5.39 feet.
As Ivan moved ashore during the morning hours of September 16th, the winds caused major damage to trees along and east of the track of the storm.  Hurricane force winds were felt across the entire area, including all inland counties.  Most of the area probably had hurricane force winds for two to four hours.  This caused 100 year old trees to break due to the constant force from the strong winds.  Many of the trees fell on homes and vehicles and damaged them.  While some structural wind damage would have been expected, most of the major structural damage that occurred over inland areas would not have been as substantial if it had not been for fallen trees.  It was estimated that in Alabama over $500,000,000 damage was done to timber,  with an additional estimate of $250,000,000 in Escambia, Santa Rosa and Okaloosa counties in Florida.  Power was out for a week or more across the inland areas due to trees across lines.  
Along the immediate coast, power was not restored for an additional several weeks, until much of the infrastructure was rebuilt.
It was estimated that six weak tornadoes occurred across the area during the afternoon and early evening of September 15th as Ivan neared the coast.  These weak tornadoes occurred in Escambia and Santa Rosa counties in Florida, and in Baldwin, Escambia and Conecuh in Alabama and produced only minor damages.   
Seven deaths were directly related to Ivan.  Six of these were in Escambia county with one in Santa Rosa county.  In Escambia county Florida: Five people (three women and two males) drowned at different locations around Grand Lagoon as the surge inundated the area.  A male drowned after his truck ran off the damaged I-10 bridge.   In Santa Rosa county, a young female died when a tree fell on their manufactured home and killed her.  
Sixteen deaths were indirectly related to Ivan.  In Escambia county Florida: A 78 year old female died of a heart attack in a shelter just before Ivan moved ashore.  A 7 year old boy was killed as he was watching someone remove a tree and a large limb fell on him.   A 58 year old  female died when she was overcome by fumes from a generator that was not properly ventilated.  A 41 year old male died in a traffic accident at an intersection with no power and no stop lights.  A 83 year old male fell off a roof while repairing damage from Ivan.  A 63 year old male fell out of a tree in Escambia county Alabama and was taken to a Pensacola hospital where he later died from injuries sustained in the fall.  A 40 year old male died when a tree fell on him.  In Santa Rosa county: A 67 year old male died of a heart attack preparing for Ivan.  A 76 year old male died of a heart attack.  A 56 year old male died of a heart attack cleaning up days after the storm.  In Okaloosa county: A 54 year old female died of a heart attack when emergency crews could not get to her due to the storm.  A 51 year old male died of a heart attack.  A 50 year old female died days after Ivan from a drug overdose due to depression cause by the storm.  
In Covington county a 75 year old female died from a fire caused by a candle used for light after the storm.  In Conecuh county a 34 year old male died from a car accident when he hit debris still in the road from the storm.  In Mobile county a 59 year old male died when a tree fell on him after the storm.
Agriculture interests suffered a major blow from Ivan with most of the soybean and pecan crop destroyed.  The cotton crop also suffered damage but not as bad as that of the soybean and pecan crop.  
Ivan will be remembered as being one of the most damaging hurricanes to affect the coastal counties of Baldwin, Escambia and Santa Rosa in modern history.  It will also be remembered as one of  the most damaging hurricanes to affect the inland counties of Escambia, Clarke, Monroe, Conecuh and Butler  in southwest Alabama.",30

Major damage also occurred along the shores of Gulf Breeze and along Blackwater Bay. Some of the highest surge values in Santa Rosa county were near Ward Basin.  Surge values across most locations east of where the center of the hurricane moved ashore were higher than those of hurricane George in 1998.  As in Escambia county, almost every structure that was on the water in Santa Rosa county suffered some type of damage.  In Okaloosa county surge values were six to nine feet.  Structures that were located on or near the beach suffered major damage.  Farther to the east, storm surge values dropped off, but the wave action essentially destroyed the beach, with four to eight feet of the sand eroded away.  Low lying structures on Choctawatchee Bay also suffered major damage.  US Highway 98 between Fort Walton and Destin was again washed away.  Structures near the beach that were part of Eglin Air Force Base also suffered major damage.
The following surge values were measured in Alabama: Middle Gage at Bayou LaBatre 4.66 feet. Mobile Bay at Cedar Point 6.90 feet. Dauphin Island Bay at Dauphin Island 7.80 feet.

Destin at Choctawatchee Bay Coast Guard 5.39 feet.
As Ivan moved ashore during the morning hours of September 16th, the winds caused major damage to trees along and east of the track of the storm.  Hurricane force winds were felt across the entire area, including all inland counties.  Most of the area probably had hurricane force winds for two to four hours.  This caused 100 year old trees to break due to the constant force from the strong winds.  Many of the trees fell on homes and vehicles and damaged them.  While some structural wind damage would have been expected, most of the major structural damage that occurred over inland areas would not have been as substantial if it had not been for fallen trees.  It was estimated that in Alabama over $500,000,000 damage was done to timber,  with an additional estimate of $250,000,000 in Escambia, Santa Rosa and Okaloosa counties in Florida.  Power was out for a week or more across the inland areas due to trees across lines.  
Along the immediate coast, power was not restored for an additional several weeks, until much of the infrastructure was rebuilt.
It was estimated that six weak tornadoes occurred across the area during the afternoon and early evening of September 15th as Ivan neared the coast.  These weak tornadoes occurred in Escambia and Santa Rosa counties in Florida, and in Baldwin, Escambia and Conecuh in Alabama and produced only minor damages.   
Seven deaths were directly related to Ivan.  Six of these were in Escambia county with one in Santa Rosa county.  In Escambia county Florida: Five people (three women and two males) drowned at different locations around Grand Lagoon as the surge inundated the area.  A male drowned after his truck ran off the damaged I-10 bridge.   In Santa Rosa county, a young female died when a tree fell on their manufactured home and killed her.  
Sixteen deaths were indirectly related to Ivan.  In Escambia county Florida: A 78 year old female died of a heart attack in a shelter just before Ivan moved ashore.  A 7 year old boy was killed as he was watching someone remove a tree and a large limb fell on him.   A 58 year old  female died when she was overcome by fumes from a generator that was not properly ventilated.  A 41 year old male died in a traffic accident at an intersection with no power and no stop lights.  A 83 year old male fell off a roof while repairing damage from Ivan.  A 63 year old male fell out of a tree in Escambia county Alabama and was taken to a Pensacola hospital where he later died from injuries sustained in the fall.  A 40 year old male died when a tree fell on him.  In Santa Rosa county: A 67 year old male died of a heart attack preparing for Ivan.  A 76 year old male died of a heart attack.  A 56 year old male died of a heart attack cleaning up days after the storm.  In Okaloosa county: A 54 year old female died of a heart attack when emergency crews could not get to her due to the storm.  A 51 year old male died of a heart attack.  A 50 year old female died days after Ivan from a drug overdose due to depression cause by the storm.  
In Covington county a 75 year old female died from a fire caused by a candle used for light after the storm.  In Conecuh county a 34 year old male died from a car accident when he hit debris still in the road from the storm.  In Mobile county a 59 year old male died when a tree fell on him after the storm.
Agriculture interests suffered a major blow from Ivan with most of the soybean and pecan crop destroyed.  The cotton crop also suffered damage but not as bad as that of the soybean and pecan crop.  
Ivan will be remembered as being one of the most damaging hurricanes to affect the coastal counties of Baldwin, Escambia and Santa Rosa in modern history.  It will also be remembered as one of  the most damaging hurricanes to affect the inland counties of Escambia, Clarke, Monroe, Conecuh and Butler  in southwest Alabama.",32

Ivan made landfall around 100 AM CST near Gulf Shores, Alabama on September 16.   An interesting note, as Ivan approached the Alabama coast during the day on the 15th, a buoy just south of the Alabama coastal waters recorded a peak wave height of 52 feet, before breaking loose of its mooring.  This was one of the highest wave heights ever observed.

Storm surge values along the coast from Baldwin county east to Santa Rosa county were the highest observed in over a hundred years of record keeping .  The high surge values of 10 to 14 feet caused extensive damage to homes and condos located along the Gulf beachfront, as well as along the shoreline of area inland waterways.  Dauphin Island had several areas that were breached by the high surge.  There was less damage on Dauphin Island than with Hurricane Frederic in 1979, even with the extensive building that has occurred on the island since 1979.  In Baldwin county, the coastal areas from Fort Morgan to Gulf Shores to Orange Beach saw the worst damage from a hurricane in over a hundred years.  This area has seen rapid development in the past 20 years and it seemed that the homes and condo's constructed in the past five years held up better than homes that were constructed earlier.  Surge values were estimated between nine and twelve feet along the Baldwin county coastline, and the beach was breached at several locations.   No one died as a result of storm surge in Baldwin county.
In Escambia county Florida, surge values were estimated at ten to fourteen feet.  These coastal areas were the hardest hit, with major damage occurring from Perdido Key to Pensacola Beach.  Almost every structure that was on the waterfront in Escambia county suffered some degree of damage.  Generally, if the property elevation was below fifteen feet, water flooded the property.  Property that was on Perdido Bay, Big Lagoon, Bayou Grande, Pensacola Bay and Escambia Bay suffered major damage.  Many homes were completely washed away by the high surge.  Almost all of the deaths directly attributed to Ivan in Escambia County were surge related, and occurred near Big Lagoon.   The beach area from Perdido Key to Pensacola Beach was breached in several places.  Fort Pickens was cut off and isolated from the rest of  Pensacola Beach as a result of several breaches.  The highest surge values observed during the storm were in the upper reaches of Escambia Bay.  The surge, and accompanying wind waves, damaged the I-10 bridge across Escambia Bay.  A trucker died on the bridge when his truck plummeted off a bridge section that had been displaced by the surge. Pensacola Naval Air Station, which is located on Pensacola Bay across from Fort Pickens, suffered major damage to structures that were located on the water.  Many of the structures had been built in the late 1800's, and had been through several other hurricanes with only minor damage.   In Santa Rosa county, surge values were between nine and twelve feet.  Navarre Beach had several breaches, and major damage occurred to almost all structures that were on the Gulf front.

An interesting note, as Ivan approached the Alabama coast during the day on the 15th, a buoy just south of the Alabama coastal waters recorded a peak wave height of 52 feet, before breaking loose of its mooring.  This was one of the highest wave heights ever observed.
Some of the winds recorded across Southwest Alabama were as follows:  Mobile Regional Airport, sustained wind of 51 knots from the north with a peak gust of 65 knots from the north northeast.

Storm surge values along the coast from Baldwin county east to Santa Rosa county were the highest observed in over a hundred years of record keeping .  The high surge values of 10 to 14 feet caused extensive damage to homes and condos located along the Gulf beachfront, as well as along the shoreline of area inland waterways.  Dauphin Island had several areas that were breached by the high surge.  There was less damage on Dauphin Island than with Hurricane Frederic in 1979, even with the extensive building that has occurred on the island since 1979.  In Baldwin county, the coastal areas from Fort Morgan to Gulf Shores to Orange Beach saw the worst damage from a hurricane in over a hundred years.  This area has seen rapid development in the past 20 years and it seemed that the homes and condo's constructed in the past five years held up better than homes that were constructed earlier.  Surge values were estimated between nine and twelve feet along the Baldwin county coastline, and the beach was breached at several locations.   No one died as a result of storm surge in Baldwin county.
In Escambia county Florida, surge values were estimated at ten to fourteen feet.  These coastal areas were the hardest hit, with major damage occurring from Perdido Key to Pensacola Beach.  Almost every structure that was on the waterfront in Escambia county suffered some degree of damage.  Generally, if the property elevation was below fifteen feet, water flooded the property.  Property that was on Perdido Bay, Big Lagoon, Bayou Grande, Pensacola Bay and Escambia Bay suffered major damage.  Many homes were completely washed away by the high surge.  Almost all of the deaths directly attributed to Ivan in Escambia County were surge related, and occurred near Big Lagoon.   The beach area from Perdido Key to Pensacola Beach was breached in several places.  Fort Pickens was cut off and isolated from the rest of  Pensacola Beach as a result of several breaches.  The highest surge values observed during the storm were in the upper reaches of Escambia Bay.  The surge, and accompanying wind waves, damaged the I-10 bridge across Escambia Bay.  A trucker died on the bridge when his truck plummeted off a bridge section that had been displaced by the surge. Pensacola Naval Air Station, which is located on Pensacola Bay across from Fort Pickens, suffered major damage to structures that were located on the water.  Many of the structures had been built in the late 1800's, and had been through several other hurricanes with only minor damage.   In Santa Rosa county, surge values were between nine and twelve feet.  Navarre Beach had several breaches, and major damage occurred to almost all structures that were on the Gulf front.   Major damage also occurred along the shores of Gulf Breeze and along Blackwater Bay. Some of the highest surge values in Santa Rosa county were near Ward Basin.  Surge values across most locations east of where the center of the hurricane moved ashore were higher than those of hurricane George in 1998.  As in Escambia county, almost every structure that was on the water in Santa Rosa county suffered some type of damage.  In Okaloosa county surge values were six to nine feet.  Structures that were located on or near the beach suffered major damage.  Farther to the east, storm surge values dropped off, but the wave action essentially destroyed the beach, with four to eight feet of the sand eroded away.  Low lying structures on Choctawatchee Bay also suffered major damage.  US Highway 98 between Fort Walton and Destin was again washed away.  Structures near the beach that were part of Eglin Air Force Base also suffered major damage.
The following surge values were measured in Alabama: Middle Gage at Bayou LaBatre 4.66 feet. Mobile Bay at Cedar Point 6.90 feet. Dauphin Island Bay at Dauphin Island 7.80 feet.  Mobile Bay at Dauphin Island Coast Guard 8.00 feet. Mobile River at Mobile 4.87 feet. Mobile River at Bucks 6.82 feet. Mobile Bay at Fort Morgan Front Range 7.85 feet. Perdido Pass at Orange Beach 8.81 feet.
The following surge values were measured in Northwest Florida; Perdido Bay near US Highway 98 estimated 10.00 feet. GIWW at Pensacola Gulf Beach 9.68 feet. Pensacola Bay at Fort McRee 9.70 feet. Pensacola Bay at Pensacola 10.20 feet. Escambia Bay West Bank at Highway 90 12.92 feet. Escambia Bay West Bank 1.5 miles north of I-10 12.12 feet.  Escambia Bay near Pace estimated 12.00 feet. GIWW at Gulf Breeze 10.30 feet. Pensacola Beach Fire Station estimated 12 feet. Yellow River near Milton 9.66 feet. Fort Walton Brooks Bridge 6.12 feet. Destin at Choctawatchee Bay Coast Guard 5.39 feet.
As Ivan moved ashore during the morning hours of September 16th, the winds caused major damage to trees along and east of the track of the storm.  Hurricane force winds were felt across the entire area, including all inland counties.  Most of the area probably had hurricane force winds for two to four hours.  This caused 100 year old trees to break due to the constant force from the strong winds.  Many of the trees fell on homes and vehicles and damaged them.  While some structural wind damage would have been expected, most of the major structural damage that occurred over inland areas would not have been as substantial if it had not been for fallen trees.  It was estimated that in Alabama over $500,000,000 damage was done to timber,  with an additional estimate of $250,000,000 in Escambia, Santa Rosa and Okaloosa counties in Florida.  Power was out for a week or more across the inland areas due to trees across lines.  
Along the immediate coast, power was not restored for an additional several weeks, until much of the infrastructure was rebuilt.
It was estimated that six weak tornadoes occurred across the area during the afternoon and early evening of September 15th as Ivan neared the coast.  These weak tornadoes occurred in Escambia and Santa Rosa counties in Florida, and in Baldwin, Escambia and Conecuh in Alabama and produced only minor damages.   
Seven deaths were directly related to Ivan.  Six of these were in Escambia county with one in Santa Rosa county.  In Escambia county Florida: Five people (three women and two males) drowned at different locations around Grand Lagoon as the surge inundated the area.  A male drowned after his truck ran off the damaged I-10 bridge.   In Santa Rosa county, a young female died when a tree fell on their manufactured home and killed her.  
Sixteen deaths were indirectly related to Ivan.  In Escambia county Florida: A 78 year old female died of a heart attack in a shelter just before Ivan moved ashore.  A 7 year old boy was killed as he was watching someone remove a tree and a large limb fell on him.   A 58 year old  female died when she was overcome by fumes from a generator that was not properly ventilated.  A 41 year old male died in a traffic accident at an intersection with no power and no stop lights.  A 83 year old male fell off a roof while repairing damage from Ivan.  A 63 year old male fell out of a tree in Escambia county Alabama and was taken to a Pensacola hospital where he later died from injuries sustained in the fall.  A 40 year old male died when a tree fell on him.  In Santa Rosa county: A 67 year old male died of a heart attack preparing for Ivan.  A 76 year old male died of a heart attack.  A 56 year old male died of a heart attack cleaning up days after the storm.  In Okaloosa county: A 54 year old female died of a heart attack when emergency crews could not get to her due to the storm.  A 51 year old male died of a heart attack.  A 50 year old female died days after Ivan from a drug overdose due to depression cause by the storm.  
In Covington county a 75 year old female died from a fire caused by a candle used for light after the storm.  In Conecuh county a 34 year old male died from a car accident when he hit debris still in the road from the storm.  In Mobile county a 59 year old male died when a tree fell on him after the storm.
Agriculture interests suffered a major blow from Ivan with most of the soybean and pecan crop destroyed.  The cotton crop also suffered damage but not as bad as that of the soybean and pecan crop.  
Ivan will be remembered as being one of the most damaging hurricanes to affect the coastal counties of Baldwin, Escambia and Santa Rosa in modern history.  It will also be remembered as one of  the most damaging hurricanes to affect the inland counties of Escambia, Clarke, Monroe, Conecuh and Butler  in southwest Alabama.",35

As Ivan moved ashore during the morning hours of September 16th, the winds caused major damage to trees along and east of the track of the storm.  Hurricane force winds were felt across the entire area, including all inland counties.  Most of the area probably had hurricane force winds for two to four hours.  This caused 100 year old trees to break due to the constant force from the strong winds.  Many of the trees fell on homes and vehicles and damaged them.  While some structural wind damage would have been expected, most of the major structural damage that occurred over inland areas would not have been as substantial if it had not been for fallen trees.  It was estimated that in Alabama over $500,000,000 damage was done to timber,  with an additional estimate of $250,000,000 in Escambia, Santa Rosa and Okaloosa counties in Florida.  Power was out for a week or more across the inland areas due to trees across lines.  
Along the immediate coast, power was not restored for an additional several weeks, until much of the infrastructure was rebuilt.
It was estimated that six weak tornadoes occurred across the area during the afternoon and early evening of September 15th as Ivan neared the coast.  These weak tornadoes occurred in Escambia and Santa Rosa counties in Florida, and in Baldwin, Escambia and Conecuh in Alabama and produced only minor damages.   
Seven deaths were directly related to Ivan.  Six of these were in Escambia county with one in Santa Rosa county.  In Escambia county Florida: Five people (three women and two males) drowned at different locations around Grand Lagoon as the surge inundated the area.  A male drowned after his truck ran off the damaged I-10 bridge.   In Santa Rosa county, a young female died when a tree fell on their manufactured home and killed her.  
Sixteen deaths were indirectly related to Ivan.  In Escambia county Florida: A 78 year old female died of a heart attack in a shelter just before Ivan moved ashore.  A 7 year old boy was killed as he was watching someone remove a tree and a large limb fell on him.   A 58 year old  female died when she was overcome by fumes from a generator that was not properly ventilated.  A 41 year old male died in a traffic accident at an intersection with no power and no stop lights.  A 83 year old male fell off a roof while repairing damage from Ivan.  A 63 year old male fell out of a tree in Escambia county Alabama and was taken to a Pensacola hospital where he later died from injuries sustained in the fall.  A 40 year old male died when a tree fell on him.  In Santa Rosa county: A 67 year old male died of a heart attack preparing for Ivan.  A 76 year old male died of a heart attack.  A 56 year old male died of a heart attack cleaning up days after the storm.  In Okaloosa county: A 54 year old female died of a heart attack when emergency crews could not get to her due to the storm.  A 51 year old male died of a heart attack.  A 50 year old female died days after Ivan from a drug overdose due to depression cause by the storm.  
In Covington county a 75 year old female died from a fire caused by a candle used for light after the storm.  In Conecuh county a 34 year old male died from a car accident when he hit debris still in the road from the storm.  In Mobile county a 59 year old male died when a tree fell on him after the storm.
Agriculture interests suffered a major blow from Ivan with most of the soybean and pecan crop destroyed.  The cotton crop also suffered damage but not as bad as that of the soybean and pecan crop.  
Ivan will be remembered as being one of the most damaging hurricanes to affect the coastal counties of Baldwin, Escambia and Santa Rosa in modern history.  It will also be remembered as one of  the most damaging hurricanes to affect the inland counties of Escambia, Clarke, Monroe, Conecuh and Butler  in southwest Alabama.",37

Ivan made landfall around 100 AM CST near Gulf Shores, Alabama on September 16.   An interesting note, as Ivan approached the Alabama coast during the day on the 15th, a buoy just south of the Alabama coastal waters recorded a peak wave height of 52 feet, before breaking loose of its mooring.  This was one of the highest wave heights ever observed.

Storm surge values along the coast from Baldwin county east to Santa Rosa county were the highest observed in over a hundred years of record keeping .  The high surge values of 10 to 14 feet caused extensive damage to homes and condos located along the Gulf beachfront, as well as along the shoreline of area inland waterways.  Dauphin Island had several areas that were breached by the high surge.  There was less damage on Dauphin Island than with Hurricane Frederic in 1979, even with the extensive building that has occurred on the island since 1979.  In Baldwin county, the coastal areas from Fort Morgan to Gulf Shores to Orange Beach saw the worst damage from a hurricane in over a hundred years.  This area has seen rapid development in the past 20 years and it seemed that the homes and condo's constructed in the past five years held up better than homes that were constructed earlier.  Surge values were estimated between nine and twelve feet along the Baldwin county coastline, and the beach was breached at several locations.   No one died as a result of storm surge in Baldwin county.
In Escambia county Florida, surge values were estimated at ten to fourteen feet.  These coastal areas were the hardest hit, with major damage occurring from Perdido Key to Pensacola Beach.  Almost every structure that was on the waterfront in Escambia county suffered some degree of damage.  Generally, if the property elevation was below fifteen feet, water flooded the property.  Property that was on Perdido Bay, Big Lagoon, Bayou Grande, Pensacola Bay and Escambia Bay suffered major damage.  Many homes were completely washed away by the high surge.  Almost all of the deaths directly attributed to Ivan in Escambia County were surge related, and occurred near Big Lagoon.   The beach area from Perdido Key to Pensacola Beach was breached in several places.  Fort Pickens was cut off and isolated from the rest of  Pensacola Beach as a result of several breaches.  The highest surge values observed during the storm were in the upper reaches of Escambia Bay.  The surge, and accompanying wind waves, damaged the I-10 bridge across Escambia Bay.  A trucker died on the bridge when his truck plummeted off a bridge section that had been displaced by the surge. Pensacola Naval Air Station, which is located on Pensacola Bay across from Fort Pickens, suffered major damage to structures that were located on the water.  Many of the structures had been built in the late 1800's, and had been through several other hurricanes with only minor damage.   In Santa Rosa county, surge values were between nine and twelve feet.  Navarre Beach had several breaches, and major damage occurred to almost all structures that were on the Gulf front.   Major damage also occurred along the shores of Gulf Breeze and along Blackwater Bay. Some of the highest surge values in Santa Rosa county were near Ward Basin.  Surge values across most locations east of where the center of the hurricane moved ashore were higher than those of hurricane George in 1998.  As in Escambia county, almost every structure that was on the water in Santa Rosa county suffered some type of damage.  In Okaloosa county surge values were six to nine feet.  Structures that were located on or near the beach suffered major damage.  Farther to the east, storm surge values dropped off, but the wave action essentially destroyed the beach, with four to eight feet of the sand eroded away.  Low lying structures on Choctawatchee Bay also suffered major damage.  US Highway 98 between Fort Walton and Destin was again washed away.  Structures near the beach that were part of Eglin Air Force Base also suffered major damage.
The following surge values were measured in Alabama: Middle Gage at Bayou LaBatre 4.66 feet. Mobile Bay at Cedar Point 6.90 feet. Dauphin Island Bay at Dauphin Island 7.80 feet.

Storm surge values along the coast from Baldwin county east to Santa Rosa county were the highest observed in over a hundred years of record keeping .  The high surge values of 10 to 14 feet caused extensive damage to homes and condos located along the Gulf beachfront, as well as along the shoreline of area inland waterways.  Dauphin Island had several areas that were breached by the high surge.  There was less damage on Dauphin Island than with Hurricane Frederic in 1979, even with the extensive building that has occurred on the island since 1979.  In Baldwin county, the coastal areas from Fort Morgan to Gulf Shores to Orange Beach saw the worst damage from a hurricane in over a hundred years.  This area has seen rapid development in the past 20 years and it seemed that the homes and condo's constructed in the past five years held up better than homes that were constructed earlier.  Surge values were estimated between nine and twelve feet along the Baldwin county coastline, and the beach was breached at several locations.   No one died as a result of storm surge in Baldwin county.
In Escambia county Florida, surge values were estimated at ten to fourteen feet.  These coastal areas were the hardest hit, with major damage occurring from Perdido Key to Pensacola Beach.  Almost every structure that was on the waterfront in Escambia county suffered some degree of damage.  Generally, if the property elevation was below fifteen feet, water flooded the property.  Property that was on Perdido Bay, Big Lagoon, Bayou Grande, Pensacola Bay and Escambia Bay suffered major damage.  Many homes were completely washed away by the high surge.  Almost all of the deaths directly attributed to Ivan in Escambia County were surge related, and occurred near Big Lagoon.   The beach area from Perdido Key to Pensacola Beach was breached in several places.  Fort Pickens was cut off and isolated from the rest of  Pensacola Beach as a result of several breaches.  The highest surge values observed during the storm were in the upper reaches of Escambia Bay.  The surge, and accompanying wind waves, damaged the I-10 bridge across Escambia Bay.  A trucker died on the bridge when his truck plummeted off a bridge section that had been displaced by the surge. Pensacola Naval Air Station, which is located on Pensacola Bay across from Fort Pickens, suffered major damage to structures that were located on the water.  Many of the structures had been built in the late 1800's, and had been through several other hurricanes with only minor damage.   In Santa Rosa county, surge values were between nine and twelve feet.  Navarre Beach had several breaches, and major damage occurred to almost all structures that were on the Gulf front.   Major damage also occurred along the shores of Gulf Breeze and along Blackwater Bay. Some of the highest surge values in Santa Rosa county were near Ward Basin.  Surge values across most locations east of where the center of the hurricane moved ashore were higher than those of hurricane George in 1998.  As in Escambia county, almost every structure that was on the water in Santa Rosa county suffered some type of damage.  In Okaloosa county surge values were six to nine feet.  Structures that were located on or near the beach suffered major damage.  Farther to the east, storm surge values dropped off, but the wave action essentially destroyed the beach, with four to eight feet of the sand eroded away.  Low lying structures on Choctawatchee Bay also suffered major damage.  US Highway 98 between Fort Walton and Destin was again washed away.  Structures near the beach that were part of Eglin Air Force Base also suffered major damage.
The following surge values were measured in Alabama: Middle Gage at Bayou LaBatre 4.66 feet. Mobile Bay at Cedar Point 6.90 feet. Dauphin Island Bay at Dauphin Island 7.80 feet.  Mobile Bay at Dauphin Island Coast Guard 8.00 feet. Mobile River at Mobile 4.87 feet. Mobile River at Bucks 6.82 feet. Mobile Bay at Fort Morgan Front Range 7.85 feet. Perdido Pass at Orange Beach 8.81 feet.
The following surge values were measured in Northwest Florida; Perdido Bay near US Highway 98 estimated 10.00 feet. GIWW at Pensacola Gulf Beach 9.68 feet. Pensacola Bay at Fort McRee 9.70 feet. Pensacola Bay at Pensacola 10.20 feet. Escambia Bay West Bank at Highway 90 12.92 feet. Escambia Bay West Bank 1.5 miles north of I-10 12.12 feet.  Escambia Bay near Pace estimated 12.00 feet. GIWW at Gulf Breeze 10.30 feet. Pensacola Beach Fire Station estimated 12 feet. Yellow River near Milton 9.66 feet. Fort Walton Brooks Bridge 6.12 feet. Destin at Choctawatchee Bay Coast Guard 5.39 feet.
As Ivan moved ashore during the morning hours of September 16th, the winds caused major damage to trees along and east of the track of the storm.  Hurricane force winds were felt across the entire area, including all inland counties.  Most of the area probably had hurricane force winds for two to four hours.  This caused 100 year old trees to break due to the constant force from the strong winds.  Many of the trees fell on homes and vehicles and damaged them.  While some structural wind damage would have been expected, most of the major structural damage that occurred over inland areas would not have been as substantial if it had not been for fallen trees.  It was estimated that in Alabama over $500,000,000 damage was done to timber,  with an additional estimate of $250,000,000 in Escambia, Santa Rosa and Okaloosa counties in Florida.  Power was out for a week or more across the inland areas due to trees across lines.  
Along the immediate coast, power was not restored for an additional several weeks, until much of the infrastructure was rebuilt.
It was estimated that six weak tornadoes occurred across the area during the afternoon and early evening of September 15th as Ivan neared the coast.  These weak tornadoes occurred in Escambia and Santa Rosa counties in Florida, and in Baldwin, Escambia and Conecuh in Alabama and produced only minor damages.   
Seven deaths were directly related to Ivan.  Six of these were in Escambia county with one in Santa Rosa county.  In Escambia county Florida: Five people (three women and two males) drowned at different locations around Grand Lagoon as the surge inundated the area.  A male drowned after his truck ran off the damaged I-10 bridge.   In Santa Rosa county, a young female died when a tree fell on their manufactured home and killed her.  
Sixteen deaths were indirectly related to Ivan.  In Escambia county Florida: A 78 year old female died of a heart attack in a shelter just before Ivan moved ashore.  A 7 year old boy was killed as he was watching someone remove a tree and a large limb fell on him.   A 58 year old  female died when she was overcome by fumes from a generator that was not properly ventilated.  A 41 year old male died in a traffic accident at an intersection with no power and no stop lights.  A 83 year old male fell off a roof while repairing damage from Ivan.  A 63 year old male fell out of a tree in Escambia county Alabama and was taken to a Pensacola hospital where he later died from injuries sustained in the fall.  A 40 year old male died when a tree fell on him.  In Santa Rosa county: A 67 year old male died of a heart attack preparing for Ivan.  A 76 year old male died of a heart attack.  A 56 year old male died of a heart attack cleaning up days after the storm.  In Okaloosa county: A 54 year old female died of a heart attack when emergency crews could not get to her due to the storm.  A 51 year old male died of a heart attack.  A 50 year old female died days after Ivan from a drug overdose due to depression cause by the storm.  
In Covington county a 75 year old female died from a fire caused by a candle used for light after the storm.  In Conecuh county a 34 year old male died from a car accident when he hit debris still in the road from the storm.  In Mobile county a 59 year old male died when a tree fell on him after the storm.
Agriculture interests suffered a major blow from Ivan with most of the soybean and pecan crop destroyed.  The cotton crop also suffered damage but not as bad as that of the soybean and pecan crop.  
Ivan will be remembered as being one of the most damaging hurricanes to affect the coastal counties of Baldwin, Escambia and Santa Rosa in modern history.  It will also be remembered as one of  the most damaging hurricanes to affect the inland counties of Escambia, Clarke, Monroe, Conecuh and Butler  in southwest Alabama.",40

The highest storm tides from Katrina occurred at: Mobile State Docks with 11.45 feet.  USS Alabama with 12.0 feet. Dauphin Island with 6.63 feet. Perdido Pass with 5.81 feet.  Pensacola with 5.37 feet.  Santa  Rosa Sound with 4.10 feet.  Destin with 4.56 feet. Some other estimated values: Bayou La Batre with 11-14 feet.  Dog River area 10-13 feet.  Baldwin county with 9-11 feet.  Escambia county with 7-9 feet.  Santa rosa with 5-8 feet.  Okaloosa county with 4-6 feet.  The surge values in Mobile Bay were among the highest ever recorded for the area.  Over 20 million dollars in damage was done to the Alabama State Docks due to the high surge.
Major beach erosion occurred from Dauphin Island to east of Destin.  The west end of Dauphin Island was completely under water with most of the homes on the west end washed away.  Flash flooding occurred throughout the day as Katrina moved inland.  
High winds from Katrina caused significant tree and power line damage to the counties that border the Mississippi and Alabama state line.  Stone and Perry counties in Mississippi received the most damage.  The damage in those two counties resembled the inland damage that hurricane Ivan produced in Alabama last year. Highway 98 in Okaloosa county again had some of the lanes damage due to surge.  I-10 bridge across Pensacola Bay was closed for several hours due to high winds.  The Wallace Tunnel was closed due to high water from the surge.  Most of the businesses on the Causeway over Mobile Bay were damaged or destroyed by the high water.  An oil rig being worked on broke free and floated up Mobile Bay and became lodged underneath the Cochran-Africatown Bridge.  The bridge had to be closed for several hours until it could be inspected for damage.  Several weak tornadoes occurred across the area.
No direct deaths were reported with Katrina in southeast Mississippi, southwest Alabama and northwest Florida.",64

However, after approximately a week of slow development, the system moved into warm Gulf of Mexico waters and rapidly intensified into a major hurricane as it moved north towards the Florida Panhandle. After a 2-day long intensification period over the eastern Gulf, Michael made landfall as an unprecedented (for the region) high-end category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale in the Florida Panhandle with maximum sustained wind speed of 155 mph and a minimum pressure 919 mb. Based on wind, Michael is the fourth most powerful hurricane to hit the United States, behind the Labor Day Hurricane (1935), Hurricane Camille (1969) and Hurricane Andrew (1992), and the most powerful storm to impact the Florida Panhandle in recorded history.  Based on central pressure, Michael is the third most powerful hurricane to hit the United States, behind only the Labor Day Hurricane (1935) and Hurricane Camille (1969).  The storm caused catastrophic damage from wind and storm surge, particularly in the Panama City Beach to Mexico Beach to Cape San Blas areas. The widespread catastrophic damage spread well inland as Hurricane Michael remained at category 3 strength into southwest Georgia.||One of the hardest hit locations was from Mexico Beach to Indian Pass where 9 to 14 feet of peak storm surge inundation was observed. In addition, wave action caused even higher total water values and this resulted in waves destroying the second story of multiple buildings in Mexico Beach.||At St. Joseph Peninsula State Park on Cape San Blas, the storm surge cut through the peninsula, creating two inlets, resulting in portions of the park no longer being accessible by vehicle. These new inlets truly demonstrate the power of storm surge.||While preliminary peak storm surge inundation was slightly less east of Indian Pass, values were still life-threatening and caused significant damage. Along the coast, portions of U.S. 98 and Alligator Drive were washed out and had to be patched/repaved. In Carrabelle, water was high enough to enter a restaurant, resulting in damage to furniture. In addition, numerous homes along the coast were destroyed or damaged as water slammed against the structures.||In addition to the life-threatening storm surge, structural damage was extensive particularly across the Florida Panhandle. Preliminary data assessments indicate almost 50,000 structures were affected across the Florida Panhandle, western Big Bend, southwest Georgia and southeast Alabama. Of these, more than 3,000 structures were destroyed. Homes and businesses were not the only structures impacted. The Hurricane Michael Preliminary Virtual Assessment Team (P-VAT) report from the Structural Extreme Event Reconnaissance Network indicated that two hospitals in Bay County, Bay Medical Sacred Heart and Gulf Coast Regional Medical Center also sustained significant damage. One hospital had glass crack and cladding stripped off the building while the other hospital had issues with power and water. Tyndall Air Force Base (AFB), that experienced the eye of Hurricane Michael, experienced catastrophic damage with every building on base experiencing some roof damage. A nearby elementary school had a portion of its roof ripped off. During the height of the storm, before the transmission stopped, a sensor at Tyndall AFB measured a gust to 139 mph.||The wind damage was not confined to the coastline, but extended well inland. In Marianna, businesses lost their roofs and the exterior wall of some buildings collapsed as the roof was lost. In Donalsonville, GA, where a 115 mph gust was measured, roof damage was also observed and at least one silo was flipped over. Even in Albany, GA, signs were blown down and roofs were peeled off buildings.||In addition to extensive structural damage, hurricane force winds caused widespread power outages across a large portion of the tri-state region. Nearly 100% of customers across a large portion of the Florida Panhandle lost power, with some of these outages lasting weeks. These widespread power outages extended into southwest Georgia with 100% of customers losing power all the way up to Lee County, GA!||Property damage estimates were still being calculated at the time of this publication and will likely rise further from what is indicated here.  However, one estimate of insured losses from the state of Florida alone was as high as $4.2 billion.||The catastrophic winds also resulted in damage to the timber and agricultural communities across Florida and Georgia. According to the Florida Forest Service, in Florida, timber damage costs estimates were over $1.2 billion dollars with almost 3 million acres of forested land damaged. In addition to damage costs, replanting in the more severely damaged areas could be an addition $240 million. This damage also has impacts to the wildfire potential with additional forest fuels from downed trees.  According to Florida Commissioner of Agriculture Adam Putnam, the state suffered nearly $1.5 billion in agricultural damages due to Michael.  The estimated damages were as follows:  Forestry $1.3 billion, Cotton $49.9 million, Cattle $43.3 million, Peanuts $23 million, Nurseries and Floriculture $16.1 million, Poultry and Eggs $10 million, Vegetables $8.6 million, Other Field Crops $7.3 million, Dairy $6.4 million, Aquaculture $5 million, Fruit $4.4 million, Tree Nuts $4.1 million, and Apiary $2 million.  ||In Georgia, 2,368,226 acres of forestland was impacted by Hurricane Michael. The estimated value of this land is $762,683,909. Catastrophic damage was mainly confined to Seminole, Decatur and Miller Counties with severe damage extending into Dougherty and Terrell Counties.  Additional crop damage occurred in Georgia to cotton, vegetables, pecans, poultry, peanuts, and timber.  According to Georgia Agriculture Commissioner Gary Black, estimated damages were as follows:  Cotton $300-$900 million, Vegetables $480 million, Pecans $560 million, Poultry $25 million, Peanuts $10-$20 million, and Timber $1 billion.||Inland flooding associated with Hurricane Michael across the tri-state region was limited as the hurricane quickly tracked across the area. A maximum rainfall total of 6.84 inches was observed near Crossroads, GA (Quitman County) with the second highest amount for the region recorded in Calhoun County, FL with 6.66 inches. With these higher rainfall amounts isolated, only a few areas of inland flooding were observed. In Bay County, record flooding was observed on the Econfina Creek at State Road 20 with 26.17 feet (NAVD88). This resulted in the SR-20 bridge being overtopped. In addition, in Calhoun County, FL, moderate flooding occurred on the Chipola River near Altha. A few homes were impacted downstream from the gauge and significant damage was sustained to the fish camps along the river.  There were no recorded tornadoes across the Florida Panhandle, Big Bend, southwest Georgia or southeast Alabama associated with Hurricane Michael.",65

Sally produced widespread wind, storm surge, and freshwater flooding across coastal AL and the western Florida Panhandle. Flood and wind damage also extended well inland into inland southwest Alabama and south central Alabama. Sally was an extremely slow moving hurricane, which prolonged and exacerbated the local impacts. The storm was moving at less than 5 mph at the time of landfall, resulting in a long duration of tropical storm and hurricane force winds, storm surge, and torrential rainfall. ||Storm surge and resultant damage was widespread and significant from Baldwin County eastward to Okaloosa County. The highest surge occurred in the bays and sounds of Alabama and the western Florida Panhandle, with generally lower values and lesser impacts on the immediate Gulf facing shores. A peak inundation of 7 to 9 feet above ground level was officially surveyed across some locations in the back bays and sounds of southeast Baldwin County, as well as the northern end of Escambia and Blackwater Bays. A larger area was impacted by 3 to 6 feet of inundation, including along the immediate Gulf facing shores. It should be noted that the extremely heavy rainfall (more details to follow) likely exacerbated the total water levels, although it is difficult to determine the exact extent. Regardless, thousands of structures along coastal areas were flooded by the surge. ||Wind damage was extensive across the region, especially in areas that experienced the eyewall of Sally over a several hour duration. Wind damage was most extensive from southeast Mobile County eastward across Baldwin County AL into Escambia County FL. These locations experienced prolonged hurricane conditions with wind gusts over 100 mph, especially close to the immediate coast. Many homes across the area suffered roof damage from the winds and an untold number of homes were damaged by fallen trees. The tree damage was most extensive in Baldwin County, but also significant in parts of Mobile and Escambia Counties which experienced hurricane conditions. The pecan farms of Baldwin County took a major hit with well over a thousand pecan trees downed throughout the county.||The very slow movement of Sally resulted in rainfall totals of 15 to 30 inches across Baldwin County into the western Florida Panhandle. 7 to 15 inches of rain fell across parts of inland southwest Alabama, along and east of Interstate 65, and south central Alabama. This torrential rain resulted in major river and flash flooding, especially in Baldwin County eastward into the Florida Panhandle. Thousands of water rescues were conducted during the storm due to rapidly rising water and many homes were flooded. Road closures were extensive, especially in Baldwin County east into the western Florida Panhandle and some roads were damaged or washed out. Several rivers reached moderate to major flood stage and some crested within the top 5 of their historical crests. ||There were 3 direct fatalities as a result of Sally. One fatality occurred in the Wolf Bay area (Baldwin County AL.) Two men were riding the storm out on their boat and at some point during the storm attempted to swim to shore. One of the men made it to a pier and was rescued and hospitalised; the other man drowned. The second fatality occurred on Innerarity Point, FL (Escambia County FL) where a 45 year old woman drowned when the vehicle she was driving was overtaken by the incoming storm surge. The third fatality occurred in Perdido Key, FL (Escambia County FL) when a 27 year old man drowned trying to retrieve a boat that was swept away by the surge and high surf. ||There were also 3 indirect fatalities. One was due to storm cleanup in the Foley, AL area with two others (one in both Baldwin County and Escambia County FL) due to carbon monoxide poisoning from improper generator use.||The total reported damage from Public Assistance (PA) and Individual Assistance (IA) is near $550 million. Note that this does not include insured losses and damages. Also, not all county reports were available or finalized at the time of this publication. A breakdown of costs related to each individual hazard was unavailable. All damages are listed under either the Hurricane or Tropical Storm hazard, but it should be noted that a good portion of the damage was caused by storm surge or flooding even though it is not explicitly listed. ||Timber loss was extensive. The Alabama Forestry Commission estimates that 2,440 forested acres were damaged with 79,175 tons of timber destroyed at a value of $1,564,160. Most of this occurred in Baldwin County. ||A study by the University of Florida estimates that total agricultural losses in the western Florida Panhandle ranged from $55 to $100 million.||Here is a breakdown of county by county impacts:||Mobile County AL: The greatest impact of Sally in Mobile County was to Dauphin Island, which was impacted by the western eyewall of Sally for a long duration. Hurricane force winds with gusts over 100 mph were recorded on the island. Winds were out of the north, which resulted in the bay and sound side of the island being the most impacted. Several buildings experienced roof and siding damage, including to two buildings on the campus of the Dauphin Island Sea Lab. Another home on the island lost its roof entirely. A 3 to 4 foot storm surge on the north side of the island resulted in major damage to docks and piers, including at the Dauphin Island marina. Across mainland Mobile county, the southern and central portions of the county experienced a long duration of sustained tropical storm force winds with hurricane force wind gusts recorded all the way west at the Mobile Regional Airport. In fact, the 82 mph gust recorded at the airport was almost as high as the peak gust recorded in Hurricane Katrina of 83 mph. Numerous trees and power lines were downed across the county, especially in central and southern parts of the county. This resulted in widespread power outages. Mobile's Bienville Square suffered major damage to the numerous oaks in the area and there was minor damage reported at some businesses in downtown Mobile. Several homes in the county also experienced roof, siding, and fence damage. Downed trees also damaged some homes. ||Baldwin County AL: The county experienced widespread damage as the eye of Sally moved across a large portion of the county after making landfall in Gulf Shores, AL. A large|storm surge resulted in widespread inundation and major flood damage to structures along the back bay waters with little to no structural damage to buildings along the Gulf facing beaches. There was a walkway at the Cotton Bayou Gulf access that was damaged. The greatest surge occurred east of Gulf Shores across Orange Beach to the Florida State line and all the way north into the northern portion of Perdido Bay, as well as Wolf Bay. Peak inundation was surveyed to be 7 to 9 feet above ground with a much larger area that experienced 3 to 6 feet of inundation. Surge values neared 10 feet above ground at the far western end of Cotton Bayou in Orange Beach. Numerous large boats were moved onto land by the surge. Almost all piers were destroyed and several marinas were heavily damaged. The Gulf State Park Pier in Gulf Shores was also majorly damaged with a large section of the pier now missing. The 20 to 30 inches of rain that fell across the southern part of the county certainly compounded the storm surge flooding and also resulted in widespread flash flooding and river flooding. The Fish and Styx Rivers reached major flood stage and experienced their third and second highest crests respectively. The eyewall of Sally resulted in widespread and extensive damage to trees and power lines. Most of southern Baldwin county experienced sustained hurricane force winds of 75 to 85 mph with gusts over 100 mph. A sailboat anchored in Ingram Bayou measured a 1 minute sustained wind of 113 mph with a gust to 137 mph. These measurements were recorded at an elevated 58 feet. When reduced to the standard measuring height 33 feet, the sustained wind is estimated to have been 104 mph with a gust to 126 mph. The Center of Severe Weather Research recorded a 123 mph gust on the east side of the Perdido Pass bridge from an anemometer on their mobile doppler radar unit with sustained winds of 93 mph. Numerous structures were damaged by fallen trees and many structures in the county suffered significant roof and siding damage. In Ft. Morgan, a few older homes were destroyed and a boat storage facility at a marina suffered major damage. Almost all of the county lost power during the storm due to substantial damage to the power infrastructure. The pecan farming industry took a devastating hit as likely over a thousand pecan trees were destroyed across the county. There were three fatalities from the storm, one direct and two indirect. A person drowned in Orange Beach during the storm. Another fatality occurred in Foley during the post storm clean up and another individual died due to carbon monoxide poisoning from a generator.||Escambia County FL: A combination of strong wind and storm surge resulted in widespread damage to Escambia County. To date, 1,756 structures were damaged. 44 structures were destroyed and 629 suffered major damage. Hurricane force winds resulted in siding and roof damage to many structures, with downed trees also playing a large role in damage to some|structures. Power outages were widespread. Pensacola NAS recorded sustained hurricane force winds with gusts of 92 mph. A large storm surge impacted the county, with the highest surge occurring in the Perdido Key area and along portions of Pensacola and Escambia Bays. Peak inundation of 7 to 9 feet above ground level was surveyed across the northern portions of Pensacola, Escambia, and Blackwater Bays. The tidal gauge at the Port of Pensacola measured an inundation of 5.6 feet, the third highest surge ever recorded (Ivan and the 1926 hurricane are #1 and #2.) Numerous structures had significant damage from storm surge inundation. Numerous large boats and barges were moved onto land by the surge. A portion of the Three Mile bridge across Pensacola Bay collapsed due to damage from the barges. The vast majority of the storm surge structural damage occurred along the back bays and sounds and not along the immediate Gulf facing beaches. However, significant damage occurred along the Gulf islands national seashore, particularly in the Johnson Beach and Ft. Pickens area. On Johnson Beach, the surge and wave action took out a large portion of the first line of dunes with damage even noted to some of the second line dunes. 4 to 5 ft of sand covered Johnson Beach road with damage to the road itself. Noaa aerial imagery indicates that 3 new cuts were created on the far east side of Johnson Beach. The surge along the Gulf side of Perdido Key was also significant (7-9 feet) as the water line encroached upon the entrance of some of the condos and damaged walkways and pools. The copious amounts of rain (15-30 inches) also compounded the storm surge issue as water that normally would drain into area bays, rivers, creeks, and streams had nowhere to go due to the incoming storm surge. Downtown Pensacola was one notable area hard hit by this fresh water flooding, but countless other locations, especially across central and southern Escambia county, were also hard hit by this flooding. There were 3 reported fatalities, two direct and one indirect. One person died while trying to retrieve a boat during the storm and another person died while kayaking during the storm. One person died after the storm due to carbon monoxide from a generator being run indoors.||Santa Rosa County, FL: A large storm surge had its greatest impact on the sound and bay|sides of Santa Rosa county. The largest surge occurred in the northern half of Escambia Bay as well as in Blackwater and East Bay. Peak surge inundation reached 7 to 9 feet above ground level. Numerous homes suffered significant inundation from the surge. The surge flooding was compounded by 20+ inches of rain that fell which also resulted in significant to major flash flooding and river flooding. Hurricane force wind gusts also resulted in roof and siding damage to many homes, extensive downed trees, and power lines. To date, around 1,400 residential structures have been identified as being impacted with 6 being destroyed and 139 suffering major damage. 19 commercial buildings have been documented as being impacted with major damage to 4 buildings. ||Okaloosa County, FL: A long duration of tropical storm force winds impacted Okaloosa County as the center of Hurricane Sally tracked very slowly to the east and north of the county. Significant storm surge impacted coastal areas, especially in western parts of Okaloosa county closer to the Santa Rosa line. Many homes on the sound side of the Mary Esther area were inundated by the surge flooding. Portions of Highway 98 on Okaloosa Island were breached by the surge flooding, however the road was not damaged. A 2 ft seawall was breached in Ft. Walton Beach with 2 to 3 ft of water covered adjacent portions of Highway 98. Walkovers and beach side docks were displaced on the Gulf side. A few restaurants and homes suffered some flooding along Calhoun avenue, likely from a combination of the torrential rainfall and storm surge. The copious rainfall also resulted in flash flooding and major river flooding, which also flooded homes in the county.||Escambia County, AL:|Widespread trees were downed throughout Escambia county, AL. Some of the trees fell onto homes, but most of the damage was minor. However, 4 homes suffered major damage from the fallen trees. At the peak of the event, 85% of the county was without power. Torrential rainfall|of 10 to 20 inches led to flash flooding and river flooding, resulting in the 10 county roads becoming impassable during the storm. Some of the roads suffered wash outs. A couple of bridges experienced wash outs as well.||Covington County, AL:|Five homes suffered wind damage as tropical storm force winds impacted Covington county. Trees and power lines were downed which resulted in some power outages. Numerous roads were flooded and impassable. Several roads also suffered wash outs due to the extensive flooding.|||Crenshaw County, AL: Tropical storm force wind gusts downed some trees and power lines in|the county. Significant flooding also occurred, especially in the southern half of the county. Numerous roads were impassable and some experienced washouts.||Monroe County, AL: Tropical storm conditions downed numerous trees and power lines|across Monroe county.||Clarke County, AL:  Tropical storm force winds downed trees across Clarke county. One tree|fell onto a home in Grove Hill, resulting in significant damage.||Conecuh County, AL: Tropical storm force winds downed trees and power lines in Conecuh|County.||Butler County, AL:  Tropical storm conditions downed trees and power lines across portions of Butler county. A few homes suffered minor damage from fallen trees. Scattered power outages were reported. A few roads were flooded from heavy rain.",66

Downtown Pensacola was one notable area hard hit by this fresh water flooding, but countless other locations, especially across central and southern Escambia county, were also hard hit by this flooding. There were 3 reported fatalities, two direct and one indirect. One person died while trying to retrieve a boat during the storm and another person died while kayaking during the storm. One person died after the storm due to carbon monoxide from a generator being run indoors.||Santa Rosa County, FL: A large storm surge had its greatest impact on the sound and bay|sides of Santa Rosa county. The largest surge occurred in the northern half of Escambia Bay as well as in Blackwater and East Bay. Peak surge inundation reached 7 to 9 feet above ground level. Numerous homes suffered significant inundation from the surge. The surge flooding was compounded by 20+ inches of rain that fell which also resulted in significant to major flash flooding and river flooding. Hurricane force wind gusts also resulted in roof and siding damage to many homes, extensive downed trees, and power lines. To date, around 1,400 residential structures have been identified as being impacted with 6 being destroyed and 139 suffering major damage. 19 commercial buildings have been documented as being impacted with major damage to 4 buildings. ||Okaloosa County, FL: A long duration of tropical storm force winds impacted Okaloosa County as the center of Hurricane Sally tracked very slowly to the east and north of the county. Significant storm surge impacted coastal areas, especially in western parts of Okaloosa county closer to the Santa Rosa line. Many homes on the sound side of the Mary Esther area were inundated by the surge flooding. Portions of Highway 98 on Okaloosa Island were breached by the surge flooding, however the road was not damaged. A 2 ft seawall was breached in Ft. Walton Beach with 2 to 3 ft of water covered adjacent portions of Highway 98. Walkovers and beach side docks were displaced on the Gulf side. A few restaurants and homes suffered some flooding along Calhoun avenue, likely from a combination of the torrential rainfall and storm surge. The copious rainfall also resulted in flash flooding and major river flooding, which also flooded homes in the county.||Escambia County, AL:|Widespread trees were downed throughout Escambia county, AL. Some of the trees fell onto homes, but most of the damage was minor. However, 4 homes suffered major damage from the fallen trees. At the peak of the event, 85% of the county was without power. Torrential rainfall|of 10 to 20 inches led to flash flooding and river flooding, resulting in the 10 county roads becoming impassable during the storm. Some of the roads suffered wash outs. A couple of bridges experienced wash outs as well.||Covington County, AL:|Five homes suffered wind damage as tropical storm force winds impacted Covington county. Trees and power lines were downed which resulted in some power outages. Numerous roads were flooded and impassable.

Sally produced widespread wind, storm surge, and freshwater flooding across coastal AL and the western Florida Panhandle. Flood and wind damage also extended well inland into inland southwest Alabama and south central Alabama. Sally was an extremely slow moving hurricane, which prolonged and exacerbated the local impacts. The storm was moving at less than 5 mph at the time of landfall, resulting in a long duration of tropical storm and hurricane force winds, storm surge, and torrential rainfall. ||Storm surge and resultant damage was widespread and significant from Baldwin County eastward to Okaloosa County. The highest surge occurred in the bays and sounds of Alabama and the western Florida Panhandle, with generally lower values and lesser impacts on the immediate Gulf facing shores. A peak inundation of 7 to 9 feet above ground level was officially surveyed across some locations in the back bays and sounds of southeast Baldwin County, as well as the northern end of Escambia and Blackwater Bays. A larger area was impacted by 3 to 6 feet of inundation, including along the immediate Gulf facing shores. It should be noted that the extremely heavy rainfall (more details to follow) likely exacerbated the total water levels, although it is difficult to determine the exact extent. Regardless, thousands of structures along coastal areas were flooded by the surge. ||Wind damage was extensive across the region, especially in areas that experienced the eyewall of Sally over a several hour duration. Wind damage was most extensive from southeast Mobile County eastward across Baldwin County AL into Escambia County FL. These locations experienced prolonged hurricane conditions with wind gusts over 100 mph, especially close to the immediate coast. Many homes across the area suffered roof damage from the winds and an untold number of homes were damaged by fallen trees. The tree damage was most extensive in Baldwin County, but also significant in parts of Mobile and Escambia Counties which experienced hurricane conditions. The pecan farms of Baldwin County took a major hit with well over a thousand pecan trees downed throughout the county.||The very slow movement of Sally resulted in rainfall totals of 15 to 30 inches across Baldwin County into the western Florida Panhandle. 7 to 15 inches of rain fell across parts of inland southwest Alabama, along and east of Interstate 65, and south central Alabama. This torrential rain resulted in major river and flash flooding, especially in Baldwin County eastward into the Florida Panhandle. Thousands of water rescues were conducted during the storm due to rapidly rising water and many homes were flooded. Road closures were extensive, especially in Baldwin County east into the western Florida Panhandle and some roads were damaged or washed out. Several rivers reached moderate to major flood stage and some crested within the top 5 of their historical crests. ||There were 3 direct fatalities as a result of Sally. One fatality occurred in the Wolf Bay area (Baldwin County AL.) Two men were riding the storm out on their boat and at some point during the storm attempted to swim to shore. One of the men made it to a pier and was rescued and hospitalised; the other man drowned. The second fatality occurred on Innerarity Point, FL (Escambia County FL) where a 45 year old woman drowned when the vehicle she was driving was overtaken by the incoming storm surge. The third fatality occurred in Perdido Key, FL (Escambia County FL) when a 27 year old man drowned trying to retrieve a boat that was swept away by the surge and high surf. ||There were also 3 indirect fatalities. One was due to storm cleanup in the Foley, AL area with two others (one in both Baldwin County and Escambia County FL) due to carbon monoxide poisoning from improper generator use.||The total reported damage from Public Assistance (PA) and Individual Assistance (IA) is near $550 million. Note that this does not include insured losses and damages. Also, not all county reports were available or finalized at the time of this publication. A breakdown of costs related to each individual hazard was unavailable. All damages are listed under either the Hurricane or Tropical Storm hazard, but it should be noted that a good portion of the damage was caused by storm surge or flooding even though it is not explicitly listed. ||Timber loss was extensive. The Alabama Forestry Commission estimates that 2,440 forested acres were damaged with 79,175 tons of timber destroyed at a value of $1,564,160. Most of this occurred in Baldwin County. ||A study by the University of Florida estimates that total agricultural losses in the western Florida Panhandle ranged from $55 to $100 million.||Here is a breakdown of county by county impacts:||Mobile County AL: The greatest impact of Sally in Mobile County was to Dauphin Island, which was impacted by the western eyewall of Sally for a long duration. Hurricane force winds with gusts over 100 mph were recorded on the island. Winds were out of the north, which resulted in the bay and sound side of the island being the most impacted. Several buildings experienced roof and siding damage, including to two buildings on the campus of the Dauphin Island Sea Lab. Another home on the island lost its roof entirely. A 3 to 4 foot storm surge on the north side of the island resulted in major damage to docks and piers, including at the Dauphin Island marina. Across mainland Mobile county, the southern and central portions of the county experienced a long duration of sustained tropical storm force winds with hurricane force wind gusts recorded all the way west at the Mobile Regional Airport. In fact, the 82 mph gust recorded at the airport was almost as high as the peak gust recorded in Hurricane Katrina of 83 mph. Numerous trees and power lines were downed across the county, especially in central and southern parts of the county. This resulted in widespread power outages. Mobile's Bienville Square suffered major damage to the numerous oaks in the area and there was minor damage reported at some businesses in downtown Mobile. Several homes in the county also experienced roof, siding, and fence damage. Downed trees also damaged some homes. ||Baldwin County AL: The county experienced widespread damage as the eye of Sally moved across a large portion of the county after making landfall in Gulf Shores, AL. A large|storm surge resulted in widespread inundation and major flood damage to structures along the back bay waters with little to no structural damage to buildings along the Gulf facing beaches. There was a walkway at the Cotton Bayou Gulf access that was damaged. The greatest surge occurred east of Gulf Shores across Orange Beach to the Florida State line and all the way north into the northern portion of Perdido Bay, as well as Wolf Bay. Peak inundation was surveyed to be 7 to 9 feet above ground with a much larger area that experienced 3 to 6 feet of inundation. Surge values neared 10 feet above ground at the far western end of Cotton Bayou in Orange Beach. Numerous large boats were moved onto land by the surge. Almost all piers were destroyed and several marinas were heavily damaged. The Gulf State Park Pier in Gulf Shores was also majorly damaged with a large section of the pier now missing. The 20 to 30 inches of rain that fell across the southern part of the county certainly compounded the storm surge flooding and also resulted in widespread flash flooding and river flooding. The Fish and Styx Rivers reached major flood stage and experienced their third and second highest crests respectively. The eyewall of Sally resulted in widespread and extensive damage to trees and power lines. Most of southern Baldwin county experienced sustained hurricane force winds of 75 to 85 mph with gusts over 100 mph. A sailboat anchored in Ingram Bayou measured a 1 minute sustained wind of 113 mph with a gust to 137 mph. These measurements were recorded at an elevated 58 feet. When reduced to the standard measuring height 33 feet, the sustained wind is estimated to have been 104 mph with a gust to 126 mph. The Center of Severe Weather Research recorded a 123 mph gust on the east side of the Perdido Pass bridge from an anemometer on their mobile doppler radar unit with sustained winds of 93 mph. Numerous structures were damaged by fallen trees and many structures in the county suffered significant roof and siding damage. In Ft. Morgan, a few older homes were destroyed and a boat storage facility at a marina suffered major damage. Almost all of the county lost power during the storm due to substantial damage to the power infrastructure. The pecan farming industry took a devastating hit as likely over a thousand pecan trees were destroyed across the county. There were three fatalities from the storm, one direct and two indirect. A person drowned in Orange Beach during the storm. Another fatality occurred in Foley during the post storm clean up and another individual died due to carbon monoxide poisoning from a generator.||Escambia County FL: A combination of strong wind and storm surge resulted in widespread damage to Escambia County. To date, 1,756 structures were damaged. 44 structures were destroyed and 629 suffered major damage. Hurricane force winds resulted in siding and roof damage to many structures, with downed trees also playing a large role in damage to some|structures. Power outages were widespread. Pensacola NAS recorded sustained hurricane force winds with gusts of 92 mph. A large storm surge impacted the county, with the highest surge occurring in the Perdido Key area and along portions of Pensacola and Escambia Bays. Peak inundation of 7 to 9 feet above ground level was surveyed across the northern portions of Pensacola, Escambia, and Blackwater Bays. The tidal gauge at the Port of Pensacola measured an inundation of 5.6 feet, the third highest surge ever recorded (Ivan and the 1926 hurricane are #1 and #2.) Numerous structures had significant damage from storm surge inundation. Numerous large boats and barges were moved onto land by the surge. A portion of the Three Mile bridge across Pensacola Bay collapsed due to damage from the barges. The vast majority of the storm surge structural damage occurred along the back bays and sounds and not along the immediate Gulf facing beaches. However, significant damage occurred along the Gulf islands national seashore, particularly in the Johnson Beach and Ft. Pickens area. On Johnson Beach, the surge and wave action took out a large portion of the first line of dunes with damage even noted to some of the second line dunes. 4 to 5 ft of sand covered Johnson Beach road with damage to the road itself. Noaa aerial imagery indicates that 3 new cuts were created on the far east side of Johnson Beach. The surge along the Gulf side of Perdido Key was also significant (7-9 feet) as the water line encroached upon the entrance of some of the condos and damaged walkways and pools.

Regardless, thousands of structures along coastal areas were flooded by the surge. ||Wind damage was extensive across the region, especially in areas that experienced the eyewall of Sally over a several hour duration. Wind damage was most extensive from southeast Mobile County eastward across Baldwin County AL into Escambia County FL. These locations experienced prolonged hurricane conditions with wind gusts over 100 mph, especially close to the immediate coast. Many homes across the area suffered roof damage from the winds and an untold number of homes were damaged by fallen trees. The tree damage was most extensive in Baldwin County, but also significant in parts of Mobile and Escambia Counties which experienced hurricane conditions. The pecan farms of Baldwin County took a major hit with well over a thousand pecan trees downed throughout the county.||The very slow movement of Sally resulted in rainfall totals of 15 to 30 inches across Baldwin County into the western Florida Panhandle. 7 to 15 inches of rain fell across parts of inland southwest Alabama, along and east of Interstate 65, and south central Alabama. This torrential rain resulted in major river and flash flooding, especially in Baldwin County eastward into the Florida Panhandle. Thousands of water rescues were conducted during the storm due to rapidly rising water and many homes were flooded. Road closures were extensive, especially in Baldwin County east into the western Florida Panhandle and some roads were damaged or washed out. Several rivers reached moderate to major flood stage and some crested within the top 5 of their historical crests. ||There were 3 direct fatalities as a result of Sally. One fatality occurred in the Wolf Bay area (Baldwin County AL.) Two men were riding the storm out on their boat and at some point during the storm attempted to swim to shore. One of the men made it to a pier and was rescued and hospitalised; the other man drowned. The second fatality occurred on Innerarity Point, FL (Escambia County FL) where a 45 year old woman drowned when the vehicle she was driving was overtaken by the incoming storm surge. The third fatality occurred in Perdido Key, FL (Escambia County FL) when a 27 year old man drowned trying to retrieve a boat that was swept away by the surge and high surf. ||There were also 3 indirect fatalities. One was due to storm cleanup in the Foley, AL area with two others (one in both Baldwin County and Escambia County FL) due to carbon monoxide poisoning from improper generator use.||The total reported damage from Public Assistance (PA) and Individual Assistance (IA) is near $550 million. Note that this does not include insured losses and damages. Also, not all county reports were available or finalized at the time of this publication. A breakdown of costs related to each individual hazard was unavailable. All damages are listed under either the Hurricane or Tropical Storm hazard, but it should be noted that a good portion of the damage was caused by storm surge or flooding even though it is not explicitly listed. ||Timber loss was extensive. The Alabama Forestry Commission estimates that 2,440 forested acres were damaged with 79,175 tons of timber destroyed at a value of $1,564,160. Most of this occurred in Baldwin County. ||A study by the University of Florida estimates that total agricultural losses in the western Florida Panhandle ranged from $55 to $100 million.||Here is a breakdown of county by county impacts:||Mobile County AL: The greatest impact of Sally in Mobile County was to Dauphin Island, which was impacted by the western eyewall of Sally for a long duration. Hurricane force winds with gusts over 100 mph were recorded on the island. Winds were out of the north, which resulted in the bay and sound side of the island being the most impacted. Several buildings experienced roof and siding damage, including to two buildings on the campus of the Dauphin Island Sea Lab. Another home on the island lost its roof entirely. A 3 to 4 foot storm surge on the north side of the island resulted in major damage to docks and piers, including at the Dauphin Island marina. Across mainland Mobile county, the southern and central portions of the county experienced a long duration of sustained tropical storm force winds with hurricane force wind gusts recorded all the way west at the Mobile Regional Airport. In fact, the 82 mph gust recorded at the airport was almost as high as the peak gust recorded in Hurricane Katrina of 83 mph. Numerous trees and power lines were downed across the county, especially in central and southern parts of the county. This resulted in widespread power outages. Mobile's Bienville Square suffered major damage to the numerous oaks in the area and there was minor damage reported at some businesses in downtown Mobile. Several homes in the county also experienced roof, siding, and fence damage. Downed trees also damaged some homes. ||Baldwin County AL: The county experienced widespread damage as the eye of Sally moved across a large portion of the county after making landfall in Gulf Shores, AL. A large|storm surge resulted in widespread inundation and major flood damage to structures along the back bay waters with little to no structural damage to buildings along the Gulf facing beaches. There was a walkway at the Cotton Bayou Gulf access that was damaged. The greatest surge occurred east of Gulf Shores across Orange Beach to the Florida State line and all the way north into the northern portion of Perdido Bay, as well as Wolf Bay. Peak inundation was surveyed to be 7 to 9 feet above ground with a much larger area that experienced 3 to 6 feet of inundation. Surge values neared 10 feet above ground at the far western end of Cotton Bayou in Orange Beach. Numerous large boats were moved onto land by the surge. Almost all piers were destroyed and several marinas were heavily damaged. The Gulf State Park Pier in Gulf Shores was also majorly damaged with a large section of the pier now missing. The 20 to 30 inches of rain that fell across the southern part of the county certainly compounded the storm surge flooding and also resulted in widespread flash flooding and river flooding. The Fish and Styx Rivers reached major flood stage and experienced their third and second highest crests respectively. The eyewall of Sally resulted in widespread and extensive damage to trees and power lines. Most of southern Baldwin county experienced sustained hurricane force winds of 75 to 85 mph with gusts over 100 mph. A sailboat anchored in Ingram Bayou measured a 1 minute sustained wind of 113 mph with a gust to 137 mph. These measurements were recorded at an elevated 58 feet. When reduced to the standard measuring height 33 feet, the sustained wind is estimated to have been 104 mph with a gust to 126 mph. The Center of Severe Weather Research recorded a 123 mph gust on the east side of the Perdido Pass bridge from an anemometer on their mobile doppler radar unit with sustained winds of 93 mph. Numerous structures were damaged by fallen trees and many structures in the county suffered significant roof and siding damage. In Ft. Morgan, a few older homes were destroyed and a boat storage facility at a marina suffered major damage. Almost all of the county lost power during the storm due to substantial damage to the power infrastructure. The pecan farming industry took a devastating hit as likely over a thousand pecan trees were destroyed across the county. There were three fatalities from the storm, one direct and two indirect. A person drowned in Orange Beach during the storm. Another fatality occurred in Foley during the post storm clean up and another individual died due to carbon monoxide poisoning from a generator.||Escambia County FL: A combination of strong wind and storm surge resulted in widespread damage to Escambia County. To date, 1,756 structures were damaged. 44 structures were destroyed and 629 suffered major damage. Hurricane force winds resulted in siding and roof damage to many structures, with downed trees also playing a large role in damage to some|structures. Power outages were widespread. Pensacola NAS recorded sustained hurricane force winds with gusts of 92 mph. A large storm surge impacted the county, with the highest surge occurring in the Perdido Key area and along portions of Pensacola and Escambia Bays. Peak inundation of 7 to 9 feet above ground level was surveyed across the northern portions of Pensacola, Escambia, and Blackwater Bays. The tidal gauge at the Port of Pensacola measured an inundation of 5.6 feet, the third highest surge ever recorded (Ivan and the 1926 hurricane are #1 and #2.) Numerous structures had significant damage from storm surge inundation. Numerous large boats and barges were moved onto land by the surge. A portion of the Three Mile bridge across Pensacola Bay collapsed due to damage from the barges. The vast majority of the storm surge structural damage occurred along the back bays and sounds and not along the immediate Gulf facing beaches. However, significant damage occurred along the Gulf islands national seashore, particularly in the Johnson Beach and Ft. Pickens area. On Johnson Beach, the surge and wave action took out a large portion of the first line of dunes with damage even noted to some of the second line dunes. 4 to 5 ft of sand covered Johnson Beach road with damage to the road itself. Noaa aerial imagery indicates that 3 new cuts were created on the far east side of Johnson Beach. The surge along the Gulf side of Perdido Key was also significant (7-9 feet) as the water line encroached upon the entrance of some of the condos and damaged walkways and pools. The copious amounts of rain (15-30 inches) also compounded the storm surge issue as water that normally would drain into area bays, rivers, creeks, and streams had nowhere to go due to the incoming storm surge. Downtown Pensacola was one notable area hard hit by this fresh water flooding, but countless other locations, especially across central and southern Escambia county, were also hard hit by this flooding. There were 3 reported fatalities, two direct and one indirect. One person died while trying to retrieve a boat during the storm and another person died while kayaking during the storm. One person died after the storm due to carbon monoxide from a generator being run indoors.||Santa Rosa County, FL: A large storm surge had its greatest impact on the sound and bay|sides of Santa Rosa county. The largest surge occurred in the northern half of Escambia Bay as well as in Blackwater and East Bay. Peak surge inundation reached 7 to 9 feet above ground level. Numerous homes suffered significant inundation from the surge. The surge flooding was compounded by 20+ inches of rain that fell which also resulted in significant to major flash flooding and river flooding. Hurricane force wind gusts also resulted in roof and siding damage to many homes, extensive downed trees, and power lines. To date, around 1,400 residential structures have been identified as being impacted with 6 being destroyed and 139 suffering major damage. 19 commercial buildings have been documented as being impacted with major damage to 4 buildings. ||Okaloosa County, FL: A long duration of tropical storm force winds impacted Okaloosa County as the center of Hurricane Sally tracked very slowly to the east and north of the county. Significant storm surge impacted coastal areas, especially in western parts of Okaloosa county closer to the Santa Rosa line. Many homes on the sound side of the Mary Esther area were inundated by the surge flooding. Portions of Highway 98 on Okaloosa Island were breached by the surge flooding, however the road was not damaged. A 2 ft seawall was breached in Ft. Walton Beach with 2 to 3 ft of water covered adjacent portions of Highway 98. Walkovers and beach side docks were displaced on the Gulf side. A few restaurants and homes suffered some flooding along Calhoun avenue, likely from a combination of the torrential rainfall and storm surge. The copious rainfall also resulted in flash flooding and major river flooding, which also flooded homes in the county.||Escambia County, AL:|Widespread trees were downed throughout Escambia county, AL. Some of the trees fell onto homes, but most of the damage was minor. However, 4 homes suffered major damage from the fallen trees. At the peak of the event, 85% of the county was without power. Torrential rainfall|of 10 to 20 inches led to flash flooding and river flooding, resulting in the 10 county roads becoming impassable during the storm. Some of the roads suffered wash outs. A couple of bridges experienced wash outs as well.||Covington County, AL:|Five homes suffered wind damage as tropical storm force winds impacted Covington county. Trees and power lines were downed which resulted in some power outages. Numerous roads were flooded and impassable. Several roads also suffered wash outs due to the extensive flooding.|||Crenshaw County, AL: Tropical storm force wind gusts downed some trees and power lines in|the county. Significant flooding also occurred, especially in the southern half of the county. Numerous roads were impassable and some experienced washouts.||Monroe County, AL: Tropical storm conditions downed numerous trees and power lines|across Monroe county.||Clarke County, AL:  Tropical storm force winds downed trees across Clarke county. One tree|fell onto a home in Grove Hill, resulting in significant damage.||Conecuh County, AL: Tropical storm force winds downed trees and power lines in Conecuh|County.||Butler County, AL:  Tropical storm conditions downed trees and power lines across portions of Butler county. A few homes suffered minor damage from fallen trees. Scattered power outages were reported. A few roads were flooded from heavy rain.",70

Sally produced widespread wind, storm surge, and freshwater flooding across coastal AL and the western Florida Panhandle. Flood and wind damage also extended well inland into inland southwest Alabama and south central Alabama. Sally was an extremely slow moving hurricane, which prolonged and exacerbated the local impacts. The storm was moving at less than 5 mph at the time of landfall, resulting in a long duration of tropical storm and hurricane force winds, storm surge, and torrential rainfall. ||Storm surge and resultant damage was widespread and significant from Baldwin County eastward to Okaloosa County. The highest surge occurred in the bays and sounds of Alabama and the western Florida Panhandle, with generally lower values and lesser impacts on the immediate Gulf facing shores. A peak inundation of 7 to 9 feet above ground level was officially surveyed across some locations in the back bays and sounds of southeast Baldwin County, as well as the northern end of Escambia and Blackwater Bays. A larger area was impacted by 3 to 6 feet of inundation, including along the immediate Gulf facing shores.
