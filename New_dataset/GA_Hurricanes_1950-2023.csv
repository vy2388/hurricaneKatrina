It became a tropical storm on the 5th and a hurricane on the 6th as it moved near the southern end of Haiti.  Hurricane Dennis made its first landfall near central Cuba as a category 4 storm on the Saffir-Simpson scale.  The storm emerged into the Gulf of Mexico off the western end of Cuba on July 9th as a category 1 storm, then tracked northwest toward the Gulf Coast.  Hurricane Dennis made its U.S. landfall near Pensacola, Florida around 3 pm on July 10th, then tracked north-northwest across western Alabama into northeast Mississippi and western Tennessee on July 11th.  The effects of Dennis with respect to flooding were far reaching, especially on the east and north side of the storm.  The first outer spiral band affected north and central Georgia during the afternoon and evening of July 9th.  Numerous thunderstorms, some with very heavy rain tracked east to west across central and north Georgia.  Rainfall amounts of two to four inches were reported on the south and west side of Atlanta.  Flash flooding was reported in Carroll county where rainfall exceeded four inches in spots.  Several roads were washed out.  After a break in the rainfall overnight, widespread rain began to spread into the area from the south late in the morning on the 10th and overspread the entire region by late afternoon.  Rainfall during the afternoon and early evening was mostly light to moderate with rainfall amounts prior to 8 pm were generally in the one to two inch range.  However, as the evening progressed, the rain became increasingly concentrated in a south-to-north oriented 50-mile wide feeder band.  The tropical feeder band set up from near Americus to Chatsworth and persisted over the same areas for a period of 12 to 15 hours.  Torrential rainfall amounts fell in areas affected by the feeder band as very heavy tropical showers repeatedly tracked over the same areas.  Rainfall amounts of six to eight inches were common within the feeder band, with 10-12 inch rainfall amounts reported across the southern and western portions of the Atlanta metropolitan area.  Widespread flash flooding and flooding were reported, especially in Coweta, Douglas, Fayette, Fulton, and Cobb counties.  Hundreds of roads were washed out and hundreds of homes experienced some degree of flooding, some major.  Several rescues were required, particularly in Douglas and Cobb counties.

Wind was also a problem, but with the center of the storm tracking some 200 miles to the west of the area, sustained winds were mostly in the 20-25 mph range, with some gusts observed to near 40 mph.  A number of counties in west Georgia reported downed trees and power lines, with widespread power outages reported across the region.

Overall damage caused by Hurricane Dennis to north and central Georgia was approximately $12,000,000, most of which was the result of flash flooding or flooding.  However, nearly $250,000 was attributed to strong winds.  One death occurred as a result of strong winds during Hurricane Dennis.",51

Rainfall amounts of six to eight inches were common within the feeder band, with 10-12 inch rainfall amounts reported across the southern and western portions of the Atlanta metropolitan area.  Widespread flash flooding and flooding were reported, especially in Coweta, Douglas, Fayette, Fulton, and Cobb counties.  Hundreds of roads were washed out and hundreds of homes experienced some degree of flooding, some major.  Several rescues were required, particularly in Douglas and Cobb counties.

Wind was also a problem, but with the center of the storm tracking some 200 miles to the west of the area, sustained winds were mostly in the 20-25 mph range, with some gusts observed to near 40 mph.  A number of counties in west Georgia reported downed trees and power lines, with widespread power outages reported across the region.

Overall damage caused by Hurricane Dennis to north and central Georgia was approximately $12,000,000, most of which was the result of flash flooding or flooding.  However, nearly $250,000 was attributed to strong winds.  One death occurred as a result of strong winds during Hurricane Dennis.",75

Numerous thunderstorms, some with very heavy rain tracked east to west across central and north Georgia.  Rainfall amounts of two to four inches were reported on the south and west side of Atlanta.  Flash flooding was reported in Carroll county where rainfall exceeded four inches in spots.  Several roads were washed out.  After a break in the rainfall overnight, widespread rain began to spread into the area from the south late in the morning on the 10th and overspread the entire region by late afternoon.  Rainfall during the afternoon and early evening was mostly light to moderate with rainfall amounts prior to 8 pm were generally in the one to two inch range.  However, as the evening progressed, the rain became increasingly concentrated in a south-to-north oriented 50-mile wide feeder band.  The tropical feeder band set up from near Americus to Chatsworth and persisted over the same areas for a period of 12 to 15 hours.  Torrential rainfall amounts fell in areas affected by the feeder band as very heavy tropical showers repeatedly tracked over the same areas.  Rainfall amounts of six to eight inches were common within the feeder band, with 10-12 inch rainfall amounts reported across the southern and western portions of the Atlanta metropolitan area.  Widespread flash flooding and flooding were reported, especially in Coweta, Douglas, Fayette, Fulton, and Cobb counties.  Hundreds of roads were washed out and hundreds of homes experienced some degree of flooding, some major.  Several rescues were required, particularly in Douglas and Cobb counties.

Wind was also a problem, but with the center of the storm tracking some 200 miles to the west of the area, sustained winds were mostly in the 20-25 mph range, with some gusts observed to near 40 mph.  A number of counties in west Georgia reported downed trees and power lines, with widespread power outages reported across the region.

Overall damage caused by Hurricane Dennis to north and central Georgia was approximately $12,000,000, most of which was the result of flash flooding or flooding.  However, nearly $250,000 was attributed to strong winds.  One death occurred as a result of strong winds during Hurricane Dennis.",85

The storm emerged into the Gulf of Mexico off the western end of Cuba on July 9th as a category 1 storm, then tracked northwest toward the Gulf Coast.  Hurricane Dennis made its U.S. landfall near Pensacola, Florida around 3 pm on July 10th, then tracked north-northwest across western Alabama into northeast Mississippi and western Tennessee on July 11th.  The effects of Dennis with respect to flooding were far reaching, especially on the east and north side of the storm.  The first outer spiral band affected north and central Georgia during the afternoon and evening of July 9th.  Numerous thunderstorms, some with very heavy rain tracked east to west across central and north Georgia.  Rainfall amounts of two to four inches were reported on the south and west side of Atlanta.  Flash flooding was reported in Carroll county where rainfall exceeded four inches in spots.  Several roads were washed out.  After a break in the rainfall overnight, widespread rain began to spread into the area from the south late in the morning on the 10th and overspread the entire region by late afternoon.  Rainfall during the afternoon and early evening was mostly light to moderate with rainfall amounts prior to 8 pm were generally in the one to two inch range.  However, as the evening progressed, the rain became increasingly concentrated in a south-to-north oriented 50-mile wide feeder band.  The tropical feeder band set up from near Americus to Chatsworth and persisted over the same areas for a period of 12 to 15 hours.  Torrential rainfall amounts fell in areas affected by the feeder band as very heavy tropical showers repeatedly tracked over the same areas.  Rainfall amounts of six to eight inches were common within the feeder band, with 10-12 inch rainfall amounts reported across the southern and western portions of the Atlanta metropolitan area.  Widespread flash flooding and flooding were reported, especially in Coweta, Douglas, Fayette, Fulton, and Cobb counties.  Hundreds of roads were washed out and hundreds of homes experienced some degree of flooding, some major.  Several rescues were required, particularly in Douglas and Cobb counties.

Wind was also a problem, but with the center of the storm tracking some 200 miles to the west of the area, sustained winds were mostly in the 20-25 mph range, with some gusts observed to near 40 mph.  A number of counties in west Georgia reported downed trees and power lines, with widespread power outages reported across the region.

Overall damage caused by Hurricane Dennis to north and central Georgia was approximately $12,000,000, most of which was the result of flash flooding or flooding.  However, nearly $250,000 was attributed to strong winds.  One death occurred as a result of strong winds during Hurricane Dennis.",95

However, as the evening progressed, the rain became increasingly concentrated in a south-to-north oriented 50-mile wide feeder band.

Torrential rainfall amounts fell in areas affected by the feeder band as very heavy tropical showers repeatedly tracked over the same areas.  Rainfall amounts of six to eight inches were common within the feeder band, with 10-12 inch rainfall amounts reported across the southern and western portions of the Atlanta metropolitan area.  Widespread flash flooding and flooding were reported, especially in Coweta, Douglas, Fayette, Fulton, and Cobb counties.  Hundreds of roads were washed out and hundreds of homes experienced some degree of flooding, some major.  Several rescues were required, particularly in Douglas and Cobb counties.

Wind was also a problem, but with the center of the storm tracking some 200 miles to the west of the area, sustained winds were mostly in the 20-25 mph range, with some gusts observed to near 40 mph.  A number of counties in west Georgia reported downed trees and power lines, with widespread power outages reported across the region.

Overall damage caused by Hurricane Dennis to north and central Georgia was approximately $12,000,000, most of which was the result of flash flooding or flooding.  However, nearly $250,000 was attributed to strong winds.  One death occurred as a result of strong winds during Hurricane Dennis.",124

The first outer spiral band affected north and central Georgia during the afternoon and evening of July 9th.  Numerous thunderstorms, some with very heavy rain tracked east to west across central and north Georgia.  Rainfall amounts of two to four inches were reported on the south and west side of Atlanta.  Flash flooding was reported in Carroll county where rainfall exceeded four inches in spots.  Several roads were washed out.  After a break in the rainfall overnight, widespread rain began to spread into the area from the south late in the morning on the 10th and overspread the entire region by late afternoon.  Rainfall during the afternoon and early evening was mostly light to moderate with rainfall amounts prior to 8 pm were generally in the one to two inch range.  However, as the evening progressed, the rain became increasingly concentrated in a south-to-north oriented 50-mile wide feeder band.  The tropical feeder band set up from near Americus to Chatsworth and persisted over the same areas for a period of 12 to 15 hours.  Torrential rainfall amounts fell in areas affected by the feeder band as very heavy tropical showers repeatedly tracked over the same areas.  Rainfall amounts of six to eight inches were common within the feeder band, with 10-12 inch rainfall amounts reported across the southern and western portions of the Atlanta metropolitan area.  Widespread flash flooding and flooding were reported, especially in Coweta, Douglas, Fayette, Fulton, and Cobb counties.  Hundreds of roads were washed out and hundreds of homes experienced some degree of flooding, some major.  Several rescues were required, particularly in Douglas and Cobb counties.

Wind was also a problem, but with the center of the storm tracking some 200 miles to the west of the area, sustained winds were mostly in the 20-25 mph range, with some gusts observed to near 40 mph.  A number of counties in west Georgia reported downed trees and power lines, with widespread power outages reported across the region.

Overall damage caused by Hurricane Dennis to north and central Georgia was approximately $12,000,000, most of which was the result of flash flooding or flooding.  However, nearly $250,000 was attributed to strong winds.  One death occurred as a result of strong winds during Hurricane Dennis.",134

It became a tropical storm on the 5th and a hurricane on the 6th as it moved near the southern end of Haiti.  Hurricane Dennis made its first landfall near central Cuba as a category 4 storm on the Saffir-Simpson scale.  The storm emerged into the Gulf of Mexico off the western end of Cuba on July 9th as a category 1 storm, then tracked northwest toward the Gulf Coast.  Hurricane Dennis made its U.S. landfall near Pensacola, Florida around 3 pm on July 10th, then tracked north-northwest across western Alabama into northeast Mississippi and western Tennessee on July 11th.

Flash flooding was reported in Carroll county where rainfall exceeded four inches in spots.  Several roads were washed out.  After a break in the rainfall overnight, widespread rain began to spread into the area from the south late in the morning on the 10th and overspread the entire region by late afternoon.  Rainfall during the afternoon and early evening was mostly light to moderate with rainfall amounts prior to 8 pm were generally in the one to two inch range.  However, as the evening progressed, the rain became increasingly concentrated in a south-to-north oriented 50-mile wide feeder band.  The tropical feeder band set up from near Americus to Chatsworth and persisted over the same areas for a period of 12 to 15 hours.  Torrential rainfall amounts fell in areas affected by the feeder band as very heavy tropical showers repeatedly tracked over the same areas.  Rainfall amounts of six to eight inches were common within the feeder band, with 10-12 inch rainfall amounts reported across the southern and western portions of the Atlanta metropolitan area.  Widespread flash flooding and flooding were reported, especially in Coweta, Douglas, Fayette, Fulton, and Cobb counties.  Hundreds of roads were washed out and hundreds of homes experienced some degree of flooding, some major.  Several rescues were required, particularly in Douglas and Cobb counties.

Wind was also a problem, but with the center of the storm tracking some 200 miles to the west of the area, sustained winds were mostly in the 20-25 mph range, with some gusts observed to near 40 mph.

Dozens of homes and businesses were destroyed with property damage estimated at $12,860,000.  The poultry industry was particularly hard hit, especially in west Georgia, where the tornadoes in Heard and Carroll counties destroyed over 300,000 chickens in nearly a dozen chicken houses.  Strong thunderstorms with damaging winds were also reported in several counties that did not experience any tornadoes.  Overall damage associated with Katrina in north and central Georgia was approximately $14,000,000.

All together there were three F2 tornadoes, three F1 tornadoes, and ten F0 tornadoes within north and central Georgia.  These tornadoes resulted in one fatality and six injuries.  Dozens of homes and businesses were destroyed with property damage estimated at $12,860,000.  The poultry industry was particularly hard hit, especially in west Georgia, where the tornadoes in Heard and Carroll counties destroyed over 300,000 chickens in nearly a dozen chicken houses.

Dozens of homes and businesses were destroyed with property damage estimated at $12,860,000.  The poultry industry was particularly hard hit, especially in west Georgia, where the tornadoes in Heard and Carroll counties destroyed over 300,000 chickens in nearly a dozen chicken houses.  Strong thunderstorms with damaging winds were also reported in several counties that did not experience any tornadoes.  Overall damage associated with Katrina in north and central Georgia was approximately $14,000,000.

Strong thunderstorms with damaging winds were also reported in several counties that did not experience any tornadoes.  Overall damage associated with Katrina in north and central Georgia was approximately $14,000,000.

Because of the distance of the core of Hurricane Katrina from Georgia, rainfall problems were minor, mostly isolated reports of street flooding.  Unlike Tropical Storm Cindy and Hurricane Dennis, which affected the same areas during early July, no flash flooding in north or central Georgia during Katrina.  Gusty west winds developed on August 30th as Katrina was dissipating over the Tennessee and Ohio Valley.  However, wind gusts were mostly in the 20-30 mph range, which resulted in just isolated incidents of downed trees and power lines throughout the day across north and west Georgia.",244

Wind damaged siding and the roof of a building closest to the ocean on Center Street. Numerous trees were blown down across interior sections of Tybee Island, including several large trees on homes along U.S. Highway 80. On the southern tip of Wilmington Island, hundreds of large oaks and pines were broken and uprooted. Several trees damaged homes. Local officials indicated that the highest winds appeared to occur on the back side of Hurricane Matthew as it shifted north.","Matthew first developed into a Tropical Storm about 35 miles southeast of St. Lucia on September 28 before quickly strengthening into a powerful hurricane as it tracked westward across the Caribbean Sea. Matthew then became a hurricane about 190 miles northeast of Curacao on September 29th before reaching Category 5 strength the following day. Matthew then weakened slightly while turning north toward the Greater Antilles, remaining a Category 4 hurricane as it made landfall over Haiti���s Tiburon Peninsula early on October 4th. Matthew then continued north while maintaining a Category 4 strength before making a second landfall near the Guantanamo Province in Cuba later that day. Land interaction helped reduce the strength of Matthew to a Category 3 hurricane, before it re-intensified into a Category 4 hurricane while tracking northwest toward the Bahamas. Matthew then tracked about 25 miles west of Nassau before making  landfall for a 3rd time over Grand Bahama about 15 miles west-northwest of Freeport as a Category 4 hurricane on October 6th. Matthew then continued on a north-northwest track toward Florida before paralleling much of the Southeast coast in a slowly weakening state over the next couple days. Matthew tracked parallel to the northern half of the Southeast Georgia coast as a Category 2 hurricane (110 mph), before continuing to weaken to a Category 1 hurricane (85 mph) while passing much of the lower Southeast South Carolina coast. Minimum surface pressures of 983.1 mb at Savannah International Airport (KSAV), 980.6 mb at Beaufort Airport (KNBC) and 981.7 mb at Charleston International Airport (KCHS) where recorded as Matthew passed just offshore. Matthew then made its 4th and final landfall as a weak Category 1 hurricane (75 mph) near McClellanville, SC at approximately 1045 AM on October 8th. Matthew then re-emerged into the western Atlantic shortly after, briefly maintaining hurricane strength before transitioning into an extratropical cyclone on October 9th as it pulled away from Cape Hatteras, North Carolina. ||Across southeast Georgia and southeast South Carolina, the main impacts from Matthew included heavy rain, wind damage in the form of scattered to widespread trees and power lines blown down and storm surge, specifically along coastal locations from Tybee Island, GA north to Edisto Beach, SC. Storm total rainfall amounts generally ranged from 4.5 to 7 inches across western areas of Southeast Georgia and extreme western locations of Southeast South Carolina to 8 to 17 inches closer to the coast, highest in coastal counties of Southeast Georgia and the lower Southeast South Carolina coast. A peak storm total rainfall of 17.49 inches was recorded at Hunter Army Airfield in Georgia while a peak storm total rainfall of 16.90 inches was recorded near Edisto Island, SC. Daily record rainfall totals were also set on October 7th and October 8th at the Savannah International Airport (KSAV), 4.36 inches and 3.84 inches, at the Charleston International Airport (KCHS), 4.7 inches and 5.77 inches and in downtown Charleston (KCXM), 4.36 inches and 3.84 inches respectively. Heavy rains also led to several instances of flash flooding with damage to roads and homes and helped produce long duration flooding along the Edisto River, Ashley River and Santee River. Wind damage produced numerous to widespread power outages and damage to homes and other structures throughout the area, most significantly at locations near the coast where 60 mph to 100 mph wind gusts occurred with rainbands surrounding the passing eye wall. On October 8th, a maximum sustained wind of 75 mph and peak wind gust of 96 mph was recorded at the Tybee Island South sensor (XTYE) in Georgia while a maximum sustained wind of 67 mph was recorded at the Beaufort (XBUF) sensor in South Carolina and peak wind gust of 87 mph was recorded at the Hilton Head Airport (KHXD) sensor in South Carolina. Three deaths and 1 injury occurred from trees falling on homes or cars in Southeast Georgia.  The most extensive damage came with storm surge during Matthew. The entire Southeast Georgia and Southeast South Carolina coast was impacted by storm surge generally ranging between 2 to 5 ft with some locations as high as 6 to 8 ft. A peak surge of 7.69 ft occurred at the Fort Pulaski tide gauge at 248 AM October 8th while a peak surge of 6.20 ft occurred at the Charleston Harbor tide gauge at 5 AM October 8th.

However, after approximately a week of slow development, the system moved into warm Gulf of Mexico waters and rapidly intensified into a major hurricane as it moved north towards the Florida Panhandle. After a 2-day long intensification period over the eastern Gulf, Michael made landfall as an unprecedented (for the region) high-end category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale in the Florida Panhandle with maximum sustained wind speed of 155 mph and a minimum pressure 919 mb. Based on wind, Michael is the fourth most powerful hurricane to hit the United States, behind the Labor Day Hurricane (1935), Hurricane Camille (1969) and Hurricane Andrew (1992), and the most powerful storm to impact the Florida Panhandle in recorded history.  Based on central pressure, Michael is the third most powerful hurricane to hit the United States, behind only the Labor Day Hurricane (1935) and Hurricane Camille (1969).  The storm caused catastrophic damage from wind and storm surge, particularly in the Panama City Beach to Mexico Beach to Cape San Blas areas. The widespread catastrophic damage spread well inland as Hurricane Michael remained at category 3 strength into southwest Georgia.||One of the hardest hit locations was from Mexico Beach to Indian Pass where 9 to 14 feet of peak storm surge inundation was observed. In addition, wave action caused even higher total water values and this resulted in waves destroying the second story of multiple buildings in Mexico Beach.||At St. Joseph Peninsula State Park on Cape San Blas, the storm surge cut through the peninsula, creating two inlets, resulting in portions of the park no longer being accessible by vehicle. These new inlets truly demonstrate the power of storm surge.||While preliminary peak storm surge inundation was slightly less east of Indian Pass, values were still life-threatening and caused significant damage. Along the coast, portions of U.S. 98 and Alligator Drive were washed out and had to be patched/repaved. In Carrabelle, water was high enough to enter a restaurant, resulting in damage to furniture. In addition, numerous homes along the coast were destroyed or damaged as water slammed against the structures.||In addition to the life-threatening storm surge, structural damage was extensive particularly across the Florida Panhandle. Preliminary data assessments indicate almost 50,000 structures were affected across the Florida Panhandle, western Big Bend, southwest Georgia and southeast Alabama. Of these, more than 3,000 structures were destroyed. Homes and businesses were not the only structures impacted. The Hurricane Michael Preliminary Virtual Assessment Team (P-VAT) report from the Structural Extreme Event Reconnaissance Network indicated that two hospitals in Bay County, Bay Medical Sacred Heart and Gulf Coast Regional Medical Center also sustained significant damage. One hospital had glass crack and cladding stripped off the building while the other hospital had issues with power and water. Tyndall Air Force Base (AFB), that experienced the eye of Hurricane Michael, experienced catastrophic damage with every building on base experiencing some roof damage. A nearby elementary school had a portion of its roof ripped off. During the height of the storm, before the transmission stopped, a sensor at Tyndall AFB measured a gust to 139 mph.||The wind damage was not confined to the coastline, but extended well inland. In Marianna, businesses lost their roofs and the exterior wall of some buildings collapsed as the roof was lost. In Donalsonville, GA, where a 115 mph gust was measured, roof damage was also observed and at least one silo was flipped over. Even in Albany, GA, signs were blown down and roofs were peeled off buildings.||In addition to extensive structural damage, hurricane force winds caused widespread power outages across a large portion of the tri-state region. Nearly 100% of customers across a large portion of the Florida Panhandle lost power, with some of these outages lasting weeks. These widespread power outages extended into southwest Georgia with 100% of customers losing power all the way up to Lee County, GA!||Property damage estimates were still being calculated at the time of this publication and will likely rise further from what is indicated here.  However, one estimate of insured losses from the state of Florida alone was as high as $4.2 billion.||The catastrophic winds also resulted in damage to the timber and agricultural communities across Florida and Georgia. According to the Florida Forest Service, in Florida, timber damage costs estimates were over $1.2 billion dollars with almost 3 million acres of forested land damaged. In addition to damage costs, replanting in the more severely damaged areas could be an addition $240 million. This damage also has impacts to the wildfire potential with additional forest fuels from downed trees. |According to Florida Commissioner of Agriculture Adam Putnam, the state suffered nearly $1.5 billion in agricultural damages due to Michael. The estimated damages were as follows: Forestry $1.3 billion, Cotton $49.9 million, Cattle $43.3 million, Peanuts $23 million, Nurseries and Floriculture $16.1 million, Poultry and Eggs $10 million, Vegetables $8.6 million, Other Field Crops $7.3 million, Dairy $6.4 million, Aquaculture $5 million, Fruit $4.4 million, Tree Nuts $4.1 million, and Apiary $2 million. ||In Georgia, 2,368,226 acres of forestland was impacted by Hurricane Michael. The estimated value of this land is $762,683,909. Catastrophic damage was mainly confined to Seminole, Decatur and Miller Counties with severe damage extending into Dougherty and Terrell Counties.  Additional crop damage occurred in Georgia to cotton, vegetables, pecans, poultry, peanuts, and timber.  According to Georgia Agriculture Commissioner Gary Black, estimated damages were as follows:  Cotton $300-$900 million, Vegetables $480 million, Pecans $560 million, Poultry $25 million, Peanuts $10-$20 million, and Timber $1 billion.||Inland flooding associated with Hurricane Michael across the tri-state region was limited as the hurricane quickly tracked across the area. A maximum rainfall total of 6.84 inches was observed near Crossroads, GA (Quitman County) with the second highest amount for the region recorded in Calhoun County, FL with 6.66 inches. With these higher rainfall amounts isolated, only a few areas of inland flooding were observed. In Bay County, record flooding was observed on the Econfina Creek at State Road 20 with 26.17 feet (NAVD88). This resulted in the SR-20 bridge being overtopped. In addition, in Calhoun County, FL, moderate flooding occurred on the Chipola River near Altha.

However, after approximately a week of slow development, the system moved into warm Gulf of Mexico waters and rapidly intensified into a major hurricane as it moved north towards the Florida Panhandle. After a 2-day long intensification period over the eastern Gulf, Michael made landfall as an unprecedented (for the region) high-end category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale in the Florida Panhandle with maximum sustained wind speed of 155 mph and a minimum pressure 919 mb. Based on wind, Michael is the fourth most powerful hurricane to hit the United States, behind the Labor Day Hurricane (1935), Hurricane Camille (1969) and Hurricane Andrew (1992), and the most powerful storm to impact the Florida Panhandle in recorded history.  Based on central pressure, Michael is the third most powerful hurricane to hit the United States, behind only the Labor Day Hurricane (1935) and Hurricane Camille (1969).  The storm caused catastrophic damage from wind and storm surge, particularly in the Panama City Beach to Mexico Beach to Cape San Blas areas. The widespread catastrophic damage spread well inland as Hurricane Michael remained at category 3 strength into southwest Georgia.||One of the hardest hit locations was from Mexico Beach to Indian Pass where 9 to 14 feet of peak storm surge inundation was observed. In addition, wave action caused even higher total water values and this resulted in waves destroying the second story of multiple buildings in Mexico Beach.||At St. Joseph Peninsula State Park on Cape San Blas, the storm surge cut through the peninsula, creating two inlets, resulting in portions of the park no longer being accessible by vehicle. These new inlets truly demonstrate the power of storm surge.||While preliminary peak storm surge inundation was slightly less east of Indian Pass, values were still life-threatening and caused significant damage. Along the coast, portions of U.S. 98 and Alligator Drive were washed out and had to be patched/repaved. In Carrabelle, water was high enough to enter a restaurant, resulting in damage to furniture. In addition, numerous homes along the coast were destroyed or damaged as water slammed against the structures.||In addition to the life-threatening storm surge, structural damage was extensive particularly across the Florida Panhandle. Preliminary data assessments indicate almost 50,000 structures were affected across the Florida Panhandle, western Big Bend, southwest Georgia and southeast Alabama. Of these, more than 3,000 structures were destroyed. Homes and businesses were not the only structures impacted. The Hurricane Michael Preliminary Virtual Assessment Team (P-VAT) report from the Structural Extreme Event Reconnaissance Network indicated that two hospitals in Bay County, Bay Medical Sacred Heart and Gulf Coast Regional Medical Center also sustained significant damage. One hospital had glass crack and cladding stripped off the building while the other hospital had issues with power and water. Tyndall Air Force Base (AFB), that experienced the eye of Hurricane Michael, experienced catastrophic damage with every building on base experiencing some roof damage. A nearby elementary school had a portion of its roof ripped off. During the height of the storm, before the transmission stopped, a sensor at Tyndall AFB measured a gust to 139 mph.||The wind damage was not confined to the coastline, but extended well inland. In Marianna, businesses lost their roofs and the exterior wall of some buildings collapsed as the roof was lost. In Donalsonville, GA, where a 115 mph gust was measured, roof damage was also observed and at least one silo was flipped over. Even in Albany, GA, signs were blown down and roofs were peeled off buildings.||In addition to extensive structural damage, hurricane force winds caused widespread power outages across a large portion of the tri-state region. Nearly 100% of customers across a large portion of the Florida Panhandle lost power, with some of these outages lasting weeks. These widespread power outages extended into southwest Georgia with 100% of customers losing power all the way up to Lee County, GA!||Property damage estimates were still being calculated at the time of this publication and will likely rise further from what is indicated here.  However, one estimate of insured losses from the state of Florida alone was as high as $4.2 billion.||The catastrophic winds also resulted in damage to the timber and agricultural communities across Florida and Georgia. According to the Florida Forest Service, in Florida, timber damage costs estimates were over $1.2 billion dollars with almost 3 million acres of forested land damaged. In addition to damage costs, replanting in the more severely damaged areas could be an addition $240 million. This damage also has impacts to the wildfire potential with additional forest fuels from downed trees. |According to Florida Commissioner of Agriculture Adam Putnam, the state suffered nearly $1.5 billion in agricultural damages due to Michael. The estimated damages were as follows: Forestry $1.3 billion, Cotton $49.9 million, Cattle $43.3 million, Peanuts $23 million, Nurseries and Floriculture $16.1 million, Poultry and Eggs $10 million, Vegetables $8.6 million, Other Field Crops $7.3 million, Dairy $6.4 million, Aquaculture $5 million, Fruit $4.4 million, Tree Nuts $4.1 million, and Apiary $2 million. ||In Georgia, 2,368,226 acres of forestland was impacted by Hurricane Michael. The estimated value of this land is $762,683,909. Catastrophic damage was mainly confined to Seminole, Decatur and Miller Counties with severe damage extending into Dougherty and Terrell Counties.  Additional crop damage occurred in Georgia to cotton, vegetables, pecans, poultry, peanuts, and timber.  According to Georgia Agriculture Commissioner Gary Black, estimated damages were as follows:  Cotton $300-$900 million, Vegetables $480 million, Pecans $560 million, Poultry $25 million, Peanuts $10-$20 million, and Timber $1 billion.||Inland flooding associated with Hurricane Michael across the tri-state region was limited as the hurricane quickly tracked across the area. A maximum rainfall total of 6.84 inches was observed near Crossroads, GA (Quitman County) with the second highest amount for the region recorded in Calhoun County, FL with 6.66 inches. With these higher rainfall amounts isolated, only a few areas of inland flooding were observed. In Bay County, record flooding was observed on the Econfina Creek at State Road 20 with 26.17 feet (NAVD88). This resulted in the SR-20 bridge being overtopped. In addition, in Calhoun County, FL, moderate flooding occurred on the Chipola River near Altha.

However, after approximately a week of slow development, the system moved into warm Gulf of Mexico waters and rapidly intensified into a major hurricane as it moved north towards the Florida Panhandle. After a 2-day long intensification period over the eastern Gulf, Michael made landfall as an unprecedented (for the region) high-end category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale in the Florida Panhandle with maximum sustained wind speed of 155 mph and a minimum pressure 919 mb. Based on wind, Michael is the fourth most powerful hurricane to hit the United States, behind the Labor Day Hurricane (1935), Hurricane Camille (1969) and Hurricane Andrew (1992), and the most powerful storm to impact the Florida Panhandle in recorded history.  Based on central pressure, Michael is the third most powerful hurricane to hit the United States, behind only the Labor Day Hurricane (1935) and Hurricane Camille (1969).  The storm caused catastrophic damage from wind and storm surge, particularly in the Panama City Beach to Mexico Beach to Cape San Blas areas. The widespread catastrophic damage spread well inland as Hurricane Michael remained at category 3 strength into southwest Georgia.||One of the hardest hit locations was from Mexico Beach to Indian Pass where 9 to 14 feet of peak storm surge inundation was observed. In addition, wave action caused even higher total water values and this resulted in waves destroying the second story of multiple buildings in Mexico Beach.||At St. Joseph Peninsula State Park on Cape San Blas, the storm surge cut through the peninsula, creating two inlets, resulting in portions of the park no longer being accessible by vehicle. These new inlets truly demonstrate the power of storm surge.||While preliminary peak storm surge inundation was slightly less east of Indian Pass, values were still life-threatening and caused significant damage. Along the coast, portions of U.S. 98 and Alligator Drive were washed out and had to be patched/repaved. In Carrabelle, water was high enough to enter a restaurant, resulting in damage to furniture. In addition, numerous homes along the coast were destroyed or damaged as water slammed against the structures.||In addition to the life-threatening storm surge, structural damage was extensive particularly across the Florida Panhandle. Preliminary data assessments indicate almost 50,000 structures were affected across the Florida Panhandle, western Big Bend, southwest Georgia and southeast Alabama. Of these, more than 3,000 structures were destroyed. Homes and businesses were not the only structures impacted. The Hurricane Michael Preliminary Virtual Assessment Team (P-VAT) report from the Structural Extreme Event Reconnaissance Network indicated that two hospitals in Bay County, Bay Medical Sacred Heart and Gulf Coast Regional Medical Center also sustained significant damage. One hospital had glass crack and cladding stripped off the building while the other hospital had issues with power and water. Tyndall Air Force Base (AFB), that experienced the eye of Hurricane Michael, experienced catastrophic damage with every building on base experiencing some roof damage. A nearby elementary school had a portion of its roof ripped off. During the height of the storm, before the transmission stopped, a sensor at Tyndall AFB measured a gust to 139 mph.||The wind damage was not confined to the coastline, but extended well inland. In Marianna, businesses lost their roofs and the exterior wall of some buildings collapsed as the roof was lost. In Donalsonville, GA, where a 115 mph gust was measured, roof damage was also observed and at least one silo was flipped over. Even in Albany, GA, signs were blown down and roofs were peeled off buildings.||In addition to extensive structural damage, hurricane force winds caused widespread power outages across a large portion of the tri-state region. Nearly 100% of customers across a large portion of the Florida Panhandle lost power, with some of these outages lasting weeks. These widespread power outages extended into southwest Georgia with 100% of customers losing power all the way up to Lee County, GA!||Property damage estimates were still being calculated at the time of this publication and will likely rise further from what is indicated here.  However, one estimate of insured losses from the state of Florida alone was as high as $4.2 billion.||The catastrophic winds also resulted in damage to the timber and agricultural communities across Florida and Georgia.

In addition to damage costs, replanting in the more severely damaged areas could be an addition $240 million. This damage also has impacts to the wildfire potential with additional forest fuels from downed trees. |According to Florida Commissioner of Agriculture Adam Putnam, the state suffered nearly $1.5 billion in agricultural damages due to Michael.

This damage also has impacts to the wildfire potential with additional forest fuels from downed trees. |According to Florida Commissioner of Agriculture Adam Putnam, the state suffered nearly $1.5 billion in agricultural damages due to Michael. The estimated damages were as follows: Forestry $1.3 billion, Cotton $49.9 million, Cattle $43.3 million, Peanuts $23 million, Nurseries and Floriculture $16.1 million, Poultry and Eggs $10 million, Vegetables $8.6 million, Other Field Crops $7.3 million, Dairy $6.4 million, Aquaculture $5 million, Fruit $4.4 million, Tree Nuts $4.1 million, and Apiary $2 million. ||In Georgia, 2,368,226 acres of forestland was impacted by Hurricane Michael. The estimated value of this land is $762,683,909. Catastrophic damage was mainly confined to Seminole, Decatur and Miller Counties with severe damage extending into Dougherty and Terrell Counties.  Additional crop damage occurred in Georgia to cotton, vegetables, pecans, poultry, peanuts, and timber.  According to Georgia Agriculture Commissioner Gary Black, estimated damages were as follows:  Cotton $300-$900 million, Vegetables $480 million, Pecans $560 million, Poultry $25 million, Peanuts $10-$20 million, and Timber $1 billion.||Inland flooding associated with Hurricane Michael across the tri-state region was limited as the hurricane quickly tracked across the area. A maximum rainfall total of 6.84 inches was observed near Crossroads, GA (Quitman County) with the second highest amount for the region recorded in Calhoun County, FL with 6.66 inches. With these higher rainfall amounts isolated, only a few areas of inland flooding were observed. In Bay County, record flooding was observed on the Econfina Creek at State Road 20 with 26.17 feet (NAVD88). This resulted in the SR-20 bridge being overtopped. In addition, in Calhoun County, FL, moderate flooding occurred on the Chipola River near Altha. A few homes were impacted downstream from the gauge and significant damage was sustained to the fish camps along the river.  There were no recorded tornadoes across the Florida Panhandle, Big Bend, southwest Georgia or southeast Alabama associated with Hurricane Michael.",306

However, after approximately a week of slow development, the system moved into warm Gulf of Mexico waters and rapidly intensified into a major hurricane as it moved north towards the Florida Panhandle. After a 2-day long intensification period over the eastern Gulf, Michael made landfall as an unprecedented (for the region) high-end category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale in the Florida Panhandle with maximum sustained wind speed of 155 mph and a minimum pressure 919 mb. Based on wind, Michael is the fourth most powerful hurricane to hit the United States, behind the Labor Day Hurricane (1935), Hurricane Camille (1969) and Hurricane Andrew (1992), and the most powerful storm to impact the Florida Panhandle in recorded history.  Based on central pressure, Michael is the third most powerful hurricane to hit the United States, behind only the Labor Day Hurricane (1935) and Hurricane Camille (1969).  The storm caused catastrophic damage from wind and storm surge, particularly in the Panama City Beach to Mexico Beach to Cape San Blas areas. The widespread catastrophic damage spread well inland as Hurricane Michael remained at category 3 strength into southwest Georgia.||One of the hardest hit locations was from Mexico Beach to Indian Pass where 9 to 14 feet of peak storm surge inundation was observed. In addition, wave action caused even higher total water values and this resulted in waves destroying the second story of multiple buildings in Mexico Beach.||At St. Joseph Peninsula State Park on Cape San Blas, the storm surge cut through the peninsula, creating two inlets, resulting in portions of the park no longer being accessible by vehicle. These new inlets truly demonstrate the power of storm surge.||While preliminary peak storm surge inundation was slightly less east of Indian Pass, values were still life-threatening and caused significant damage. Along the coast, portions of U.S. 98 and Alligator Drive were washed out and had to be patched/repaved. In Carrabelle, water was high enough to enter a restaurant, resulting in damage to furniture. In addition, numerous homes along the coast were destroyed or damaged as water slammed against the structures.||In addition to the life-threatening storm surge, structural damage was extensive particularly across the Florida Panhandle. Preliminary data assessments indicate almost 50,000 structures were affected across the Florida Panhandle, western Big Bend, southwest Georgia and southeast Alabama. Of these, more than 3,000 structures were destroyed. Homes and businesses were not the only structures impacted. The Hurricane Michael Preliminary Virtual Assessment Team (P-VAT) report from the Structural Extreme Event Reconnaissance Network indicated that two hospitals in Bay County, Bay Medical Sacred Heart and Gulf Coast Regional Medical Center also sustained significant damage. One hospital had glass crack and cladding stripped off the building while the other hospital had issues with power and water. Tyndall Air Force Base (AFB), that experienced the eye of Hurricane Michael, experienced catastrophic damage with every building on base experiencing some roof damage. A nearby elementary school had a portion of its roof ripped off. During the height of the storm, before the transmission stopped, a sensor at Tyndall AFB measured a gust to 139 mph.||The wind damage was not confined to the coastline, but extended well inland. In Marianna, businesses lost their roofs and the exterior wall of some buildings collapsed as the roof was lost. In Donalsonville, GA, where a 115 mph gust was measured, roof damage was also observed and at least one silo was flipped over. Even in Albany, GA, signs were blown down and roofs were peeled off buildings.||In addition to extensive structural damage, hurricane force winds caused widespread power outages across a large portion of the tri-state region. Nearly 100% of customers across a large portion of the Florida Panhandle lost power, with some of these outages lasting weeks. These widespread power outages extended into southwest Georgia with 100% of customers losing power all the way up to Lee County, GA!||Property damage estimates were still being calculated at the time of this publication and will likely rise further from what is indicated here.  However, one estimate of insured losses from the state of Florida alone was as high as $4.2 billion.||The catastrophic winds also resulted in damage to the timber and agricultural communities across Florida and Georgia. According to the Florida Forest Service, in Florida, timber damage costs estimates were over $1.2 billion dollars with almost 3 million acres of forested land damaged. In addition to damage costs, replanting in the more severely damaged areas could be an addition $240 million.
