The tropical storm moved north across southeast Louisiana and by the evening of the 26th was located in central Mississippi where it was downgraded to a tropical depression.  Tropical Storm Isidore had a large circulation with tropical storm force winds extending several hundred miles from its center.  Prior to moving onto the Yucatan Peninsula earlier in the week and weakening, Isidore was classified as a major hurricane.

The large circulation caused a significant storm surge over a large area for a tropical storm.  Tide levels were generally 4 to 7 feet above normal, with locally higher levels, across much of coastal Mississippi. Significant beach erosion occurred along the coast and on the barrier islands.  The maximum storm surge readings on the Mississippi Coast was 7.61 ft NGVD at the Corps of Engineers tide gage at Gulfport Harbor, and 6.86 ft NGVD in Biloxi Bay at Point Cadet.

There were two fatalities on the Mississippi Coast related to the tropical storm; one direct and another indirect.  A 40 year old man in a van auto parked in parking lot drowned when storm surge flood waters flooded the parking lot during the early morning hours of Thursday, Sep 26, 2002.  A 66 year old man suffered a heart attack and died in the Point Cadet area, and emergency medical units were unable to reach him due to flood waters. 

Rainfall amounts associated with Isidore were generally 5 to 8 inches and resulted in some river flooding and flash flooding.  Approximately 2,500 homes in Hancock County, 1,400 homes in Harrison County and  50 homes and business in Jackson County were flooded, primarily as the result of storm surge, with river flooding and flash flooding causing some of the flood damage. In addition, around 300 businesses in Harrison county received flood damage. Evacuation of approximately 600 people in Harrison County, primarily from the Point Cadet area, and around 40 people in Hancock County occurred early on September 26, 2002  to rescue people in areas flooded by storm surge.

As the tropical storm moved inland, heavy rain resulted in flash flooding in Pearl River, Amite and Pike Counties, with several roads and some homes and businesses flooded.

Most areas recorded sustained winds of 25 to 35 mph with some gusts to 40 to 50 mph in squalls. The highest recorded winds on land areas were at Gulfport Airport with a maximum sustained wind of 37 mph and a gust of 50 mph.

Tropical Storm Bill moved into southeast Louisiana south of Houma around 2000 CST on Monday, June 30, 2003 then moved north northeast across southeast Louisiana and at midnight was entering south Mississippi. The affects of Tropical Storm Bill began in south Mississippi during the morning hours and continued into the early morning of July 1, 2003. The lowest pressure recorded from land stations in Mississippi was 1006.4 mb at Keesler Air Force Base in Biloxi. The maximum recorded sustained wind was 37 knots (43 mph) at the Gulfport Airport. The highest recorded wind gust in Mississippi was 45 knots (52 mph) occurring at both Gulfport Airport and Keesler Air Force Base. The greatest storm surge along the Mississippi coast was 4.99 ft MLLW recorded at the NOAA tide gage in Waveland. The highest storm total rainfall (approximately 48 hours)  was 9.49 inches at  Van Cleave.  River flooding which developed as a result of the heavy rainfall crested in early July and will be described in July Storm Data. 

The collective effect of Tropical Storm Bill in coastal Mississippi resulted in no injuries or fatalities and approximately $5 million dollars in property damage in south Mississippi. Specifically the one tornado resulted in $5 thousand dollars in damage, property damage from the strong winds was estimated at $1 million dollars, storm surge flooding resulted in 1 million dollars in damage, and heavy rainfall causing flash flooding and river flooding caused 2 million dollars in damage. Dollar damage of the storm effects are only rough estimates.","",45

The highest maximum sustained wind at a land station was 49 mph, or 43 knots, at the Pascagoula Airport. The highest wind gust measured in coastal Mississippi was 55 mph, or  48 knots,  at the Pascagoula Airport, and 60 mph, or 52 knots, at the NOAA buoy 42007 located 22 miles south southeast of Biloxi.   Heavy rainfall resulted in extensive street flooding with rainfall generally amounts ranging from 3 inches to a little over 6 inches across much of coastal Mississippi.  The lowest pressures measured were 996.2 mb at NOAA buoy 42007 located 22 miles south southeast of Biloxi and 995.0 mb at Kessler Airforce Base in Biloxi.  High tides caused minor storm surge flooding along the Mississippi coast especially in Hancock County.  The highest storm surge recorded was 6.2 feet NGVD at Ocean Springs.

Tree damage was scattered across the county as wind gusts peaked between 40 and 50 mph.","Hurricane Gustav was the 2nd major hurricane of the 2008 Atlantic Hurricane Season. It took shape as a tropical depression on the morning of August 25th just southeast of Haiti, and rapidly strengthened to hurricane status by the morning of August 26th. After inflicting serious damage on portions of Haiti, Jamaica, and Cuba, Gustav entered into the southeastern portion of the Gulf of Mexico and took aim at the Gulf Coast of the United States. Although Gustav attained Category 4 status earlier in its life, Gustav eventually made landfall as a strong Category 2 system at Cocodrie, Louisiana, on September 1st, containing maximum sustained winds around 110 mph. Gustav slowed down and weakened as it continued on its northwest track across southern Louisiana where major damage was inflicted. The pace of the system continued to slow dramatically over the next few days as it turned gradually to the right around a large ridge of high pressure over the Southeast. The remnants of Gustav finally began moving rapidly away from the Lower Mississippi Valley on the 4th as an incoming disturbance deflected it to the northeast. Gustav was responsible for multiple hazardous weather elements across the service area such as tropical storm force winds, tornadoes, flash flooding, and areal flooding from extensive rains.||As the center of Gustav crossed much of southern Louisiana, tropical storm force winds extended into southern Mississippi and portions of east central Louisiana. Sustained winds were between 35 and 45 mph with higher gusts between 70 and 100 mph occurred. Tree and power line damage was extensive across these areas which resulted in widespread power outages, some of which lasted for 3 to 5 days.||As Gustav slowed across central Louisiana, the outer rainbands continued to rotate across much of southern and central Mississippi. This kept those portions of Mississippi in the region which was favorable for tornadoes. Over 3 days, 26 tornadoes were confirmed, all of which were in the EF0 to EF1 range.||As Gustav slowed on September 2nd, flash flooding became a major issue with lasted into the 3rd as the storm slowly lifted to the north and northeast. The first round of heavy rain and flash flooding was across portions of southeast Mississippi as the outer rainbands started to move across the same areas. Total rainfall across this area was between 4 and 7 inches. The heaviest rains fell across areas near and west of the Mississippi River. Some of the Mississippi counties boarding the river received 8 to 11 inches of rain. Areas west of the river across Louisiana and southeast Arkansas saw extreme rainfall. Many locations received between 11 and 20 inches of rain. The highest measured rainfall was at Larto Lake where 21 inches fell. The flooding rains had a tremendous impact on area crops. Crop damage was extensive across Louisiana and western Mississippi. The flooding rains came at a crucial time as most crops will be harvested in September. Crop damage from Gustav will range between 300-400 million dollars.",137

In fact, intensifying from tropical depression to Category strength in 40 hours is the fastest rate of intensification of any storm on record in the Atlantic Basin. Delta quickly weakened to a category 1 hurricane after making its first landfall on the Yucatan Peninsula. It gradually recurved north towards the Louisiana coastline, fluctuating in intensity between Category 2 and 3. Hurricane Delta ultimately arrived with an intensity of 105 mph, strong category 2 storm. Local impacts include 50 to 70 MPH wind gusts across the area, surge of 2 to 3 feet above ground and widespread tree and structure damage. There were approximately 6 injuries. Delta caused approximately $10 million worth of damage across southwest and coastal Mississippi. ||It made landfall around 5 pm CT east of Cameron LA or about 15 miles east of where Category 4 Hurricane Laura made landfall just a couple of months earlier this year.
