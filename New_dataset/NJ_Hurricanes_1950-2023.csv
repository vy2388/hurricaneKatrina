The hurricane will go down in history as the greatest natural disaster to ever effect the state of New Jersey to date.  Preliminary damage estimates for the entire state were 1.1 billion dollars hitting Bergen and Somerset Counties the hardest. Manville and Bound Brook were hardest hit within Somerset County.  Six persons died in the state; all drownings: two each in Somerset and Bergen Counties, one in Passaic County and one in Salem County.  Hundreds were injured.  The hurricane caused record breaking flooding in the Raritan River Basin as storm totals averaged around ten inches. In spite of similar storm total amounts, the flooding in the Passaic River Basin did not exceed the record set in April of 1984, but reached as high as the third highest crest on record for some streams.  Excluding the northeast part of the state, storm totals elsewhere in the state ranged from three to ten inches with the highest amounts in Mercer County.  There were hundreds of rescues from creeks and trapped/submerged vehicles.  Many people ignored barricades and became stranded in flood waters. About 26,000 persons in the state were evacuated, about half of them in Somerset and Bergen Counties. Statewide 78 homes, 105 apartments (all in Somerset County) and 75 businesses were destroyed.  Statewide 3,900 homes, 1,208 apartments and 1,683 businesses suffered major damage defined as losing up to 50 percent of the property's value.  Statewide 23,235 homes, 1,758 apartments and 1,043 businesses suffered minor damage defined as suffering more than $10,000 in damage.  Statewide 39,113 homes, 2,232 apartments and 2,183 businesses suffered some damage defined as losing greater than $200 in damage. About 616,400 homes and businesses lost power throughout the state for up to five days.  About 17,800 homes and businesses, mainly around Somerset County, did not have gas service for up to two weeks.   About 500,000 persons in the Raritan Valley had to boil their water for eight days and not bathe as the flooding crippled the Elizabethtown Water Company's main water treatment plant in Bridgewater (Somerset County).  With the plant off line, water pressure was also low. Some municipalities received little, if any, water.  Other sewage treatment plants were so overwhelmed with runoff that many spewed raw sewage into the streams and rivers.  Schools were closed on the 16th as Governor Christie Whitman declared a state of emergency.  Service along Amtrak's Northeast Corridor was disrupted and not resumed until Saturday the 18th.  Service on several New Jersey Transit Lines was not resumed until the work week of the 20th.

A 40-year-old man drowned in the Salem River near Pennsville Township in Salem County.  An 85-year-old woman and her 58-year-old son drowned in Bound Brook (Somerset County) after they refused to evacuate and became trapped in their first floor apartment. The highest verifiable storm total was 14.45 inches in Pompton Lakes (Passaic County).  Nearby Philadelphia International Airport not only set a new daily precipitation record of  6.63 inches, but also a new 24 hour record of 6.77 inches. Based on SKYWARN Spotter reports and Doppler Radar precipitation estimates, the area of heaviest rain coincided with the first significant rise in elevation in the northern half of the state around the Watchung Mountains. Doppler storm total estimates of 10 to 12 inches covered much of the eastern half of Hunterdon County, the western half of Somerset County, extreme eastern parts of Morris County and adjacent areas in Essex, Passaic and Union Counties. Lesser amounts fell in the rest of northwest New Jersey.  Farther to the south, storm totals increased farther west in New Jersey with locations along the Delaware River receiving the heaviest amounts.  Doppler Radar storm total estimates reached 10 inches in Salem and Mercer Counties. The torrential downpours associated with Hurricane Floyd exceeded the 100-year-flood return period in the Raritan Basin as several rivers and streams either set record or had their second highest crest on record.  The combination of winds funneling into the Delaware Bay and the Delaware River and the record runoff from inland waterways produced minor to moderate tidal flooding at the times of high tide in Cumberland, Salem, Gloucester, Camden and Burlington Counties.  Evacuations occurred in low-lying areas near the river.  The evening (16th) high tide also slowed the discharge of streams into the Delaware.  The highest wind gusts were mainly less than 60 mph.  But, the combination of the heavy rain that loosened the ground and the persistence of the strong winds uprooted hundreds of trees.  President Clinton declared Bergen, Essex, Mercer, Middlesex, Morris, Passaic, Somerset and Union Counties a disaster area.  Homeowners in Hunterdon County were also eligible for damage assistance. 

Hurricane Floyd began as a Cape Verde type hurricane east of the Lesser Antilles.  As Floyd moved west, it passed to the north of and spared both the Greater and Lesser Antilles.  Floyd intensified into a Category IV (Major) Hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Scale.  Floyd was a large sized hurricane that  prolonged both the torrential rain and high winds.  Floyd was heading for Florida before a turn to the northwest spared the state, but Floyd battered the Bahamas.  The anticipated turn to the north and the northeast occurred on the 15th as Floyd was heading for North Carolina.  Another important synoptic feature was a cold front that was over West Virginia on the 14th.  This front stalled in Eastern Pennsylvania on the 15th.  The stalled front not only failed to push offshore an already tropical and humid air mass that was over the state, but also acted as a conduit for the tropical moisture associated with Floyd.  The moisture headed west toward the front, rising upward and dropped the heaviest rain in upslope areas of the state.  Light rain associated with Floyd started in the state on the 15th.  The torrential rain associated with Floyd arrived around 3 a.m. EDT in the southern part of the state and spread into Sussex County  by 10 a.m. EDT.  Floyd was just making landfall at the Mouth of Cape Fear or Bald Head Island in North Carolina as the heavy rain reached Mount Holly. Floyd started to accelerate northeast during the morning of the 16th.  Some gusty winds arrived in the state during the morning of the 16th.  A weakened (with respect to wind) Category One Floyd moved through Virginia Beach, Virginia and was back over the open Atlantic Ocean around noon on the 16th.  Floyd continued to move northeast and the eye passed just east of the Virginia Capes and Fenwick Island, Delaware around 3 p.m. EDT.  By the afternoon of the 16th all the torrential rain had moved north of Floyd and ended with the passage of the hurricane (on the same latitude line).  During the afternoon of the 16th all of the sustained hurricane force winds were located over the Atlantic. At 5 p.m. EDT Floyd was downgraded to a tropical storm as it passed about 10 miles east of Atlantic City.  Between 5 p.m. and 9 p.m. EDT the torrential rain ended across the state from south to north.  The strongest winds associated with Floyd mixed down as cooler air behind the system moved into the region.   For many locations the strongest wind gusts occurred between 4 p.m. and 10 p.m. EDT and the highest gusts occurred over higher terrain locations. Wind gusts rarely exceeded 50 mph, but all the flooding rains made it easier for trees to be knocked over.  Tropical Storm Floyd made landfall again on western Fire Island in Suffolk County,  New York around 8 p.m. EDT and was located near Portland, Maine at 8 a.m. EDT on the 17th. 
 
Somerset County and Bound Brook and Manville specifically were hit the hardest (in the Mount Holly, NJ area of forecast and warning responsibility).  Expressions such as "It's gone.", "It's totaled.", "It's like nothing we've seen before." were used to describe the flooding in downtown Bound Brook.  About 2,000 persons were evacuated, 800 were rescued from second story windows and rooftops in the downtown and west end areas. The downtown was covered by an estimated thirteen feet of water. Flooding stretched from Tea Street to Billian-Legion Park and reached as high as High Street.  Due to an electrical malfunction, a fire broke out in a cluster of stores on Main Street in Bound Brook.  Flood waters prevented firefighters from getting close.  Four stores were gutted, three others were heavily damaged. Borough schools were closed through the 24th.  Main Street was not reopened until October 5th. More than 200 homes were condemned.  Manville was hit equally as hard as 1,000 persons were evacuated from 360 homes in the Lost Valley section.  In all 1,500 homes were damaged and 284 homes were condemned.  The mud line was 10 feet above ground level. Both boroughs are along the Raritan River and the Raritan set new record crests at both locations breaking the previous record set during Tropical Storm Doria on August 28, 1971. Flood waters from the Raritan River also inundated the Elizabethtown Water Company's main water treatment plant in Bridgewater.  About 500,000 customers in Hunterdon, Mercer, Middlesex and Somerset Counties were forced to boil their water and advised not to bathe.  The plant tripping off line also produced low water pressure that affected numerous municipalities. The National Guard delivered more than 500,000 bottles of water. The plant started to pump some water on Monday the 20th, was back to one-third of capacity on the 23rd and cancelled the boiling advisory at 8 p.m. EDT on the 24th.  Many schools and businesses could not open until an adequate and safe water supply returned.  Flooding along the Green Brook pushed up to three feet of sewage contaminated flood waters into the first floor of Green Brook Township's Municipal Building.  In Hillsborough Township 600 homes were damaged and 200 persons were evacuated along the Millstone and Neshanic Rivers. A rescue boat capsized while trying to rescue a man trapped in a tree for two hours.  In Franklin Township, flood waters from the Raritan River reached 10 feet inside the buildings of the Zarapeth Community Church destroying 20,000 volumes of books in its Bible Institute. Damage here alone was estimated at 2.5 million dollars.  Nearly every township had flooded roads and low-lying area evacuations.  Many townships were effectively cut-off. Downed trees exacerbated the damage mainly in the northern part of the county. Seventy-five percent of all the bridges in the county were damaged.  Eight bridges remained closed in Bedminster, Bound Brook, Hillsborough and Montgomery.  Several of them were damaged from logs smashing into them.  Four bridges remained closed on October 19th.  Numerous waterways were contaminated with raw sewage, heating oil and other pollutants.  A 58-year-old building inspector became ill with Legionnaire's Disease during the clean-up.  About 4,400 persons were evacuated throughout the county, 60 persons were still in shelters on October 15th.  Many businesses in downtown Bound Brook and Manville were not expected to reopen.   

Farther downstream in Middlesex County the Raritan River flooding also took its toll.  As the Raritan River was rising, the incoming high tide during the early morning of the 17th prevented it from discharging into the bay.  Around the time of this high tide, the Raritan River caused the worst flooding in memory in Middlesex County.  About 3,300 persons were sheltered as evacuations occurred in New Brunswick, Carteret, Dunellen, Edison, South Brunswick, South Plainfield and Woodbridge. In New Brunswick the Raritan river flooded over New Jersey State Route 18. Flood waters cascaded around the New Brunswick Homes and River Watch Apartment Complexes (about 1,000 persons were evacuated), the New Brunswick Police Department and the New Brunswick Municipal Court.  Neither of the municipal buildings were used again. New Jersey State Route 18 opened the afternoon of the 18th.  Three bridges were closed. The Delaware and Raritan Canal Locks, swing bridge and tow path were damaged.  Severe flooding damage was reported in Highland Park, Middlesex Borough, Piscataway,  South Plainfield and Woodbridge.  In Middlesex Borough  500 homes were damaged and the damage estimate was 6 million dollars.  In Woodbridge, flooded stores were not expected to be reopened for weeks.  In Piscataway where damage estimates reached 5 million dollars, the Riverside, Mayflower and Birchview Apartment Complexes were severely flooded. Parks near the Raritan River were also badly damaged. In Edison, low water pressure problems associated with the Elizabethtown Water Treatment Plant resulted in little or no water for the township through the 20th.  The National Guard was providing water.  Numerous streams flooded throughout the county.  By early afternoon 30 to 40 roads throughout the county were already closed with numerous water rescues from car tops taking place.  Rutgers University canceled classes on both the 16th and 17th.  Downed trees were reported in Metuchen and over 100 homes were damaged by flooding in Dunellen.  Another affect of Floyd was the thousands of barrels and drums (some containing hazardous solvents and acids) were found bobbing in the waters of Raritan and Sandy Hook Bays and washed ashore on local beaches.        

Upstream areas in the Raritan Basin did not fare much better.  In Hunterdon County five homes were destroyed, 117 had major damage and 582 had minor damage.  Two apartments suffered major damage and 7 suffered minor damage. Twenty-four businesses also were damaged.  About 125 persons were evacuated. Five percent of all county roads were damaged and three bridges (In East Amwell, Franklin and Readington Townships) were expected to remain closed through mid November.   Hardest hit was Lambertville, especially the south side of the city near Swan Creek.  Nearly 100 homes were flooded and half the evacuations within the county occurred in this city.  The flooding creek also cracked a water pipe leaving the south side of the city with no water.  Elsewhere the elementary school was flooded with nearly two feet of water (damage estimate 1.1 million) as a creek behind the school overflowed.  The school did not reopen until Tuesday September 28th.  Other streams and rivers flooded in Alexandria, Califon, Frenchtown and Holland Townships.  High winds also damaged two homes in Holland Township and vehicles in Frenchtown Borough.

Elsewhere in Northwest New Jersey, Morris County in the Passaic Basin was hit hard.  It was one of the hardest hit counties with respect to wind damage in the state.  Hundreds of trees were knocked down.  About 1,500 persons were evacuated because of flooding.  Numerous roads were closed including NJ State Routes 10 and 23, U.S. Route 46 and NJ State Route 53.  The hardest hit municipalities were Pequannock and Lincoln Park along the Pompton River.  Flooding caused an estimated 5.5 million dollars to two hundred fifty homes in Pequannock.  One home collapsed and trapped two persons and a dog inside.  They were rescued.  Thirty-five roads alone in Pequannock were closed. Flooding along the Rockaway River caused evacuations in Denville and Dover. Three hundred homes were flooded in Dover.  Flooding along the Whippany River forced the evacuation of 50 families in Morristown and closed 15 roads in Mendham Township. Serious flooding also occurred along the South Branch of the Raritan River in Washington Township, the Loantanka Brook in Harding Township and Terrace Lake in Butler Borough.  Flooding caused the Allen Street Bridge to collapse in Netcong Borough. Numerous trees were knocked down in Boonton, Harding, Mendham, Netcong and Washington Townships.  Dozens of homes were damaged by the fallen trees.  In Mendham Township, 100 foot tall oak trees were snapped.  In Harding Township, 90 percent of the township lost power because of downed trees.  Every house on one block of Millbrook Road had downed trees on it.  School were closed through Friday the 17th throughout most of the county and New Jersey Transit Rail Service was not returned to full operations until Monday the 20th.

On a relative basis the effects of Floyd diminished across Warren and Sussex Counties.  In Franklin Township in Warren County a trailer exploded after flood waters caused a short in the wiring of a propane stove and spread to the tanks outside.  The trailer exploded, but no one was hurt since the trailer park was already evacuated because of flooding.   About 38,000 homes and businesses lost power.  Power was not fully restored until the 21st. Hardest hit were Byram Township, Frankford Township, Hopatcong Borough and the town of Newton.  Flooding caused by Floyd contaminated municipal wells in Andover and Hampton Townships. 

In Central New Jersey, Mercer County was hit the hardest and was also included in the disaster declaration. About 400 persons were evacuated in Ewing and Lawrence Townships and in Trenton.  About 85 major roads were closed including sections of Interstate 95, U.S. Routes 1 and 130 and New Jersey State Route 33. Hundreds of water rescues from trapped vehicles occurred. In Trenton the worst flood damage occurred along the Assunpink Creek.  Forty homes and three businesses were damaged on Mulberry Street, Dickinson Street and North Clinton Avenue. In Ewing Township, about 150 residents were evacuated from the Willow Creek Rehabilitation and Care Center.  In Lawrence Township, six homes were badly damaged (condemned) by flood waters from the Delaware and Raritan Canal.  Businesses, car dealerships and residents near the Shabakunk Creek also suffered flood damage.  U.S. Route 1 buckled. In Princeton, schools were closed until Monday the 20th because of the combination of flood damage and water quality problems stemming from the Elizabethtown Water Company's Bridgewater treatment plant.  High winds took their toll also.  The chimney blew down onto the roof of the Imani Community Church. Pieces of the chimney crashed through the roof.  The replacement cost was estimated at 1 million dollars.

In Monmouth County, the worst flooding related problems occurred around noon EDT as the torrential rain coincided with the high tide. The worst flooding was reported in Union Beach and bay areas of Middletown Township. Mandatory evacuations occurred in Union Beach (which became an island) and voluntary evacuations occurred in Middletown Township along the bay and near Compton's and Pew Creeks. New Jersey State Routes 35 and 36 were closed due to flooding.  Farther inland, Manalapan Township was hardest hit with overflowing brooks that forced the closure of six roads and sandbagging of homes on Birmingham Road.  The strongest winds occurred during the evening and blew down transformers, wires, tree limbs and several trees throughout the county. Coastal areas escaped with minimal damage: just some minor beach erosion and minor back bay flooding at times of high tide. Thousands of barrels and drums (some containing hazardous solvents and acids) were found bobbing in the waters of Raritan and Sandy Hook Bays and washed ashore on local beaches.  
 
Across the southern half of New Jersey, the heaviest rain and the most widespread flooding occurred in townships along the Delaware River.  Less rain and flooding occurred farther southeast with less urban and poor drainage flooding and only minor beach erosion and back bay flooding reported in Atlantic, Cape May and Ocean Counties. The worst flooding occurred along some of the larger waterways in the area (Cooper River in Camden County, Rancocas Creek in Burlington County) and along tidal sections of tributaries to the Delaware River. This peaked during the evening high tide as winds funneled into the bay and brought higher tidal departures and slowed the discharge of inland waterways. The high tide in Philadelphia reached 9.4 feet above mean lower low water at around 640 p.m. EDT.  Moderate tidal flooding starts at 9.2 feet above mean lower low water. In Burlington County, some evacuations occurred in Riverside around the Delanco-Riverside Bridge.  The bridge was also closed.  Farther upstream along the Rancocas Creek the Centerton Bridge in Willingboro was closed.  Voluntary evacuations also occurred along the Delaware River in Delran and roads near the Rancocas Creek were closed.  Several evacuations also occurred along the Assicunk Creek in Burlington City.  Creek flooding (mainly the Rancocas) occurred in Medford, Mount Holly and Westampton Townships.  About 10 roads in the county were closed due to flooding.  In Camden County the worst flooding occurred in Collingswood along U.S. Route 130 between the Airport Circle and Collings Avenue.  Some homes were flooded and evacuated as raw sewage was present.  Flooding from Floyd knocked out a state psychiatric hospital's wastewater treatment plant in Winslow Township.  Downed trees damaged a home in Blackwood Township. In Gloucester County, about 40 persons were evacuated in Gibbstown after the Gibbstown Levee partially gave way and sent water from the Delaware River and Repaupo Creek into Gibbstown.  In adjacent Logan Township, about 20 persons were evacuated near Floodgate Road.  There were also additional voluntary evacuations in low-lying areas of both Logan and Monroe Townships. Sections of U.S. Route 130 were closed. One road collapsed in Woolwich Township and the torrential rain contributed to a fatal accident on the New Jersey Turnpike. In Salem County, tidal flooding occurred in Penns Grove.  A 40-year-old man died when he fell into the Salem near Pennsville.  Several dam failures occurred. In Cumberland County, 3,700 persons living in mobile home parks in Vineland were evacuated.  Farmers also feared that the heavy rain would ruin the fall spinach crop.  In Ocean County, elderly residents of Laurelton Gardens in Brick Township were evacuated after a creek flooded.  Scattered trees and wires were knocked down throughout the county.  A tree damaged a house in Toms River.

In Somerset County the Millstone River at Blackwells Mills crested at a RECORD BREAKING 21.0 feet at 345 a.m. EDT on the 17th. Flood stage is 9 feet and the river did not return to bankfull until 7p.m. EDT on the 18th. It was the first river to reach flood stage in the county at 1 p.m. EDT. Also in Somerset County, the North Branch of the Raritan River near Raritan crested at a RECORD BREAKING 18.8 feet at 11 p.m. EDT on the 16th.  Flood stage is 10 feet.  Farther downstream the Raritan River in Manville crested at a RECORD BREAKING 27.5 feet at midnight on the 17th.  Flood stage is nearly half as low, 14 feet.  In Bound Brook the Raritan River crested at a RECORD BREAKING 42.1 feet at 1030 p.m. EDT on the 16th. Flood stage is 28 feet.  The previous record set during Tropical Storm Doria was 37.5 feet set on August 28, 1971.  Flooding started at all of the three Raritan River points around 5 p.m. EDT.  Upstream in Hunterdon County, the South Branch of the Raritan River in High Bridge crested at 10.9 feet at Midnight EDT on the 17th.  Flood stage is 10 feet.  Farther downstream in Stanton, the South Branch of the Raritan River had its second highest crest on record, 13.9 feet at 8 p.m. EDT on the 16th. Flood stage is 8 feet.  In the Passaic River Basin in Morris County, the Rockaway River above the Boonton Reservoir crested at 6.3 feet at 1215 a.m. EDT on the 17th.  Flood stage is 5 feet. The Pompton River in Pompton Plains crested at its third highest ever at 21.0 feet at 3 a.m. EDT on the 17th. Flood stage is 16 feet.  Along the main stem of the Passaic River, along the Somerset County/Morris County border, in Millington the Passaic crested at 8.8 feet at 3 a.m. EDT on the 17th. The estimated flood stage is 8 feet. In Chatham (Morris County), the Passaic River crested at 7.6 feet at 530 p.m. EDT on the 17th.  Flood stage is 6 feet.  In Pine Brook (Morris County), the Passaic River crested at 20.8 feet at 9 a.m. EDT on the 18th.  Flood stage is estimated at 19 feet.  This point remained above its estimated flood stage the longest in the Passaic Basin, the river did not return to bankfull until 7 a.m. EDT on the 23rd.  In Mercer County, the Assunpink Creek in Trenton reached its 7 foot flood stage at 9 a.m. EDT on the 17th, the first gaged stream to hit flood stage that day.  It crested at 13.9 feet at 1 a.m. EDT on the 17th, the second highest crest on record. In Burlington County, the North Branch of the Rancocas Creek in Pemberton crested at 3.2 feet at 9 p.m. EDT on the 17th.  Flood stage is 2.7 feet.  In Camden County, the Cooper River at Haddonfield crested at 3.9 feet at 5 p.m. EDT on the 16th. Flood stage is 2.8 feet.

The hurricane will go down in history as the greatest natural disaster to ever effect the state of New Jersey to date.  Preliminary damage estimates for the entire state were 1.1 billion dollars hitting Bergen and Somerset Counties the hardest. Manville and Bound Brook were hardest hit within Somerset County.  Six persons died in the state; all drownings: two each in Somerset and Bergen Counties, one in Passaic County and one in Salem County.  Hundreds were injured.  The hurricane caused record breaking flooding in the Raritan River Basin as storm totals averaged around ten inches. In spite of similar storm total amounts, the flooding in the Passaic River Basin did not exceed the record set in April of 1984, but reached as high as the third highest crest on record for some streams.  Excluding the northeast part of the state, storm totals elsewhere in the state ranged from three to ten inches with the highest amounts in Mercer County.  There were hundreds of rescues from creeks and trapped/submerged vehicles.  Many people ignored barricades and became stranded in flood waters. About 26,000 persons in the state were evacuated, about half of them in Somerset and Bergen Counties. Statewide 78 homes, 105 apartments (all in Somerset County) and 75 businesses were destroyed.  Statewide 3,900 homes, 1,208 apartments and 1,683 businesses suffered major damage defined as losing up to 50 percent of the property's value.  Statewide 23,235 homes, 1,758 apartments and 1,043 businesses suffered minor damage defined as suffering more than $10,000 in damage.  Statewide 39,113 homes, 2,232 apartments and 2,183 businesses suffered some damage defined as losing greater than $200 in damage. About 616,400 homes and businesses lost power throughout the state for up to five days.  About 17,800 homes and businesses, mainly around Somerset County, did not have gas service for up to two weeks.   About 500,000 persons in the Raritan Valley had to boil their water for eight days and not bathe as the flooding crippled the Elizabethtown Water Company's main water treatment plant in Bridgewater (Somerset County).  With the plant off line, water pressure was also low. Some municipalities received little, if any, water.  Other sewage treatment plants were so overwhelmed with runoff that many spewed raw sewage into the streams and rivers.  Schools were closed on the 16th as Governor Christie Whitman declared a state of emergency.  Service along Amtrak's Northeast Corridor was disrupted and not resumed until Saturday the 18th.  Service on several New Jersey Transit Lines was not resumed until the work week of the 20th.

A 40-year-old man drowned in the Salem River near Pennsville Township in Salem County.  An 85-year-old woman and her 58-year-old son drowned in Bound Brook (Somerset County) after they refused to evacuate and became trapped in their first floor apartment. The highest verifiable storm total was 14.45 inches in Pompton Lakes (Passaic County).  Nearby Philadelphia International Airport not only set a new daily precipitation record of  6.63 inches, but also a new 24 hour record of 6.77 inches. Based on SKYWARN Spotter reports and Doppler Radar precipitation estimates, the area of heaviest rain coincided with the first significant rise in elevation in the northern half of the state around the Watchung Mountains. Doppler storm total estimates of 10 to 12 inches covered much of the eastern half of Hunterdon County, the western half of Somerset County, extreme eastern parts of Morris County and adjacent areas in Essex, Passaic and Union Counties. Lesser amounts fell in the rest of northwest New Jersey.  Farther to the south, storm totals increased farther west in New Jersey with locations along the Delaware River receiving the heaviest amounts.  Doppler Radar storm total estimates reached 10 inches in Salem and Mercer Counties. The torrential downpours associated with Hurricane Floyd exceeded the 100-year-flood return period in the Raritan Basin as several rivers and streams either set record or had their second highest crest on record.  The combination of winds funneling into the Delaware Bay and the Delaware River and the record runoff from inland waterways produced minor to moderate tidal flooding at the times of high tide in Cumberland, Salem, Gloucester, Camden and Burlington Counties.  Evacuations occurred in low-lying areas near the river.  The evening (16th) high tide also slowed the discharge of streams into the Delaware.  The highest wind gusts were mainly less than 60 mph.  But, the combination of the heavy rain that loosened the ground and the persistence of the strong winds uprooted hundreds of trees.  President Clinton declared Bergen, Essex, Mercer, Middlesex, Morris, Passaic, Somerset and Union Counties a disaster area.  Homeowners in Hunterdon County were also eligible for damage assistance. 

Hurricane Floyd began as a Cape Verde type hurricane east of the Lesser Antilles.  As Floyd moved west, it passed to the north of and spared both the Greater and Lesser Antilles.  Floyd intensified into a Category IV (Major) Hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Scale.  Floyd was a large sized hurricane that  prolonged both the torrential rain and high winds.  Floyd was heading for Florida before a turn to the northwest spared the state, but Floyd battered the Bahamas.  The anticipated turn to the north and the northeast occurred on the 15th as Floyd was heading for North Carolina.  Another important synoptic feature was a cold front that was over West Virginia on the 14th.  This front stalled in Eastern Pennsylvania on the 15th.  The stalled front not only failed to push offshore an already tropical and humid air mass that was over the state, but also acted as a conduit for the tropical moisture associated with Floyd.  The moisture headed west toward the front, rising upward and dropped the heaviest rain in upslope areas of the state.  Light rain associated with Floyd started in the state on the 15th.  The torrential rain associated with Floyd arrived around 3 a.m. EDT in the southern part of the state and spread into Sussex County  by 10 a.m. EDT.  Floyd was just making landfall at the Mouth of Cape Fear or Bald Head Island in North Carolina as the heavy rain reached Mount Holly. Floyd started to accelerate northeast during the morning of the 16th.  Some gusty winds arrived in the state during the morning of the 16th.  A weakened (with respect to wind) Category One Floyd moved through Virginia Beach, Virginia and was back over the open Atlantic Ocean around noon on the 16th.  Floyd continued to move northeast and the eye passed just east of the Virginia Capes and Fenwick Island, Delaware around 3 p.m. EDT.  By the afternoon of the 16th all the torrential rain had moved north of Floyd and ended with the passage of the hurricane (on the same latitude line).  During the afternoon of the 16th all of the sustained hurricane force winds were located over the Atlantic. At 5 p.m. EDT Floyd was downgraded to a tropical storm as it passed about 10 miles east of Atlantic City.  Between 5 p.m. and 9 p.m. EDT the torrential rain ended across the state from south to north.  The strongest winds associated with Floyd mixed down as cooler air behind the system moved into the region.   For many locations the strongest wind gusts occurred between 4 p.m. and 10 p.m. EDT and the highest gusts occurred over higher terrain locations. Wind gusts rarely exceeded 50 mph, but all the flooding rains made it easier for trees to be knocked over.  Tropical Storm Floyd made landfall again on western Fire Island in Suffolk County,  New York around 8 p.m. EDT and was located near Portland, Maine at 8 a.m. EDT on the 17th. 
 
Somerset County and Bound Brook and Manville specifically were hit the hardest (in the Mount Holly, NJ area of forecast and warning responsibility).  Expressions such as "It's gone.", "It's totaled.", "It's like nothing we've seen before." were used to describe the flooding in downtown Bound Brook.  About 2,000 persons were evacuated, 800 were rescued from second story windows and rooftops in the downtown and west end areas. The downtown was covered by an estimated thirteen feet of water. Flooding stretched from Tea Street to Billian-Legion Park and reached as high as High Street.  Due to an electrical malfunction, a fire broke out in a cluster of stores on Main Street in Bound Brook.  Flood waters prevented firefighters from getting close.  Four stores were gutted, three others were heavily damaged. Borough schools were closed through the 24th.  Main Street was not reopened until October 5th. More than 200 homes were condemned.  Manville was hit equally as hard as 1,000 persons were evacuated from 360 homes in the Lost Valley section.  In all 1,500 homes were damaged and 284 homes were condemned.  The mud line was 10 feet above ground level. Both boroughs are along the Raritan River and the Raritan set new record crests at both locations breaking the previous record set during Tropical Storm Doria on August 28, 1971. Flood waters from the Raritan River also inundated the Elizabethtown Water Company's main water treatment plant in Bridgewater.  About 500,000 customers in Hunterdon, Mercer, Middlesex and Somerset Counties were forced to boil their water and advised not to bathe.  The plant tripping off line also produced low water pressure that affected numerous municipalities. The National Guard delivered more than 500,000 bottles of water. The plant started to pump some water on Monday the 20th, was back to one-third of capacity on the 23rd and cancelled the boiling advisory at 8 p.m. EDT on the 24th.  Many schools and businesses could not open until an adequate and safe water supply returned.  Flooding along the Green Brook pushed up to three feet of sewage contaminated flood waters into the first floor of Green Brook Township's Municipal Building.  In Hillsborough Township 600 homes were damaged and 200 persons were evacuated along the Millstone and Neshanic Rivers. A rescue boat capsized while trying to rescue a man trapped in a tree for two hours.  In Franklin Township, flood waters from the Raritan River reached 10 feet inside the buildings of the Zarapeth Community Church destroying 20,000 volumes of books in its Bible Institute. Damage here alone was estimated at 2.5 million dollars.  Nearly every township had flooded roads and low-lying area evacuations.  Many townships were effectively cut-off. Downed trees exacerbated the damage mainly in the northern part of the county. Seventy-five percent of all the bridges in the county were damaged.  Eight bridges remained closed in Bedminster, Bound Brook, Hillsborough and Montgomery.  Several of them were damaged from logs smashing into them.  Four bridges remained closed on October 19th.  Numerous waterways were contaminated with raw sewage, heating oil and other pollutants.  A 58-year-old building inspector became ill with Legionnaire's Disease during the clean-up.  About 4,400 persons were evacuated throughout the county, 60 persons were still in shelters on October 15th.  Many businesses in downtown Bound Brook and Manville were not expected to reopen.   

Farther downstream in Middlesex County the Raritan River flooding also took its toll.  As the Raritan River was rising, the incoming high tide during the early morning of the 17th prevented it from discharging into the bay.  Around the time of this high tide, the Raritan River caused the worst flooding in memory in Middlesex County.  About 3,300 persons were sheltered as evacuations occurred in New Brunswick, Carteret, Dunellen, Edison, South Brunswick, South Plainfield and Woodbridge. In New Brunswick the Raritan river flooded over New Jersey State Route 18. Flood waters cascaded around the New Brunswick Homes and River Watch Apartment Complexes (about 1,000 persons were evacuated), the New Brunswick Police Department and the New Brunswick Municipal Court.  Neither of the municipal buildings were used again. New Jersey State Route 18 opened the afternoon of the 18th.  Three bridges were closed. The Delaware and Raritan Canal Locks, swing bridge and tow path were damaged.  Severe flooding damage was reported in Highland Park, Middlesex Borough, Piscataway,  South Plainfield and Woodbridge.  In Middlesex Borough  500 homes were damaged and the damage estimate was 6 million dollars.  In Woodbridge, flooded stores were not expected to be reopened for weeks.  In Piscataway where damage estimates reached 5 million dollars, the Riverside, Mayflower and Birchview Apartment Complexes were severely flooded. Parks near the Raritan River were also badly damaged. In Edison, low water pressure problems associated with the Elizabethtown Water Treatment Plant resulted in little or no water for the township through the 20th.  The National Guard was providing water.  Numerous streams flooded throughout the county.  By early afternoon 30 to 40 roads throughout the county were already closed with numerous water rescues from car tops taking place.  Rutgers University canceled classes on both the 16th and 17th.  Downed trees were reported in Metuchen and over 100 homes were damaged by flooding in Dunellen.  Another affect of Floyd was the thousands of barrels and drums (some containing hazardous solvents and acids) were found bobbing in the waters of Raritan and Sandy Hook Bays and washed ashore on local beaches.        

Upstream areas in the Raritan Basin did not fare much better.  In Hunterdon County five homes were destroyed, 117 had major damage and 582 had minor damage.  Two apartments suffered major damage and 7 suffered minor damage. Twenty-four businesses also were damaged.  About 125 persons were evacuated. Five percent of all county roads were damaged and three bridges (In East Amwell, Franklin and Readington Townships) were expected to remain closed through mid November.   Hardest hit was Lambertville, especially the south side of the city near Swan Creek.  Nearly 100 homes were flooded and half the evacuations within the county occurred in this city.  The flooding creek also cracked a water pipe leaving the south side of the city with no water.  Elsewhere the elementary school was flooded with nearly two feet of water (damage estimate 1.1 million) as a creek behind the school overflowed.  The school did not reopen until Tuesday September 28th.  Other streams and rivers flooded in Alexandria, Califon, Frenchtown and Holland Townships.  High winds also damaged two homes in Holland Township and vehicles in Frenchtown Borough.

Elsewhere in Northwest New Jersey, Morris County in the Passaic Basin was hit hard.  It was one of the hardest hit counties with respect to wind damage in the state.  Hundreds of trees were knocked down.  About 1,500 persons were evacuated because of flooding.  Numerous roads were closed including NJ State Routes 10 and 23, U.S. Route 46 and NJ State Route 53.  The hardest hit municipalities were Pequannock and Lincoln Park along the Pompton River.  Flooding caused an estimated 5.5 million dollars to two hundred fifty homes in Pequannock.  One home collapsed and trapped two persons and a dog inside.  They were rescued.  Thirty-five roads alone in Pequannock were closed. Flooding along the Rockaway River caused evacuations in Denville and Dover. Three hundred homes were flooded in Dover.  Flooding along the Whippany River forced the evacuation of 50 families in Morristown and closed 15 roads in Mendham Township. Serious flooding also occurred along the South Branch of the Raritan River in Washington Township, the Loantanka Brook in Harding Township and Terrace Lake in Butler Borough.  Flooding caused the Allen Street Bridge to collapse in Netcong Borough. Numerous trees were knocked down in Boonton, Harding, Mendham, Netcong and Washington Townships.  Dozens of homes were damaged by the fallen trees.  In Mendham Township, 100 foot tall oak trees were snapped.  In Harding Township, 90 percent of the township lost power because of downed trees.  Every house on one block of Millbrook Road had downed trees on it.  School were closed through Friday the 17th throughout most of the county and New Jersey Transit Rail Service was not returned to full operations until Monday the 20th.

On a relative basis the effects of Floyd diminished across Warren and Sussex Counties.  In Franklin Township in Warren County a trailer exploded after flood waters caused a short in the wiring of a propane stove and spread to the tanks outside.  The trailer exploded, but no one was hurt since the trailer park was already evacuated because of flooding.   About 38,000 homes and businesses lost power.  Power was not fully restored until the 21st. Hardest hit were Byram Township, Frankford Township, Hopatcong Borough and the town of Newton.  Flooding caused by Floyd contaminated municipal wells in Andover and Hampton Townships. 

In Central New Jersey, Mercer County was hit the hardest and was also included in the disaster declaration. About 400 persons were evacuated in Ewing and Lawrence Townships and in Trenton.  About 85 major roads were closed including sections of Interstate 95, U.S. Routes 1 and 130 and New Jersey State Route 33. Hundreds of water rescues from trapped vehicles occurred. In Trenton the worst flood damage occurred along the Assunpink Creek.  Forty homes and three businesses were damaged on Mulberry Street, Dickinson Street and North Clinton Avenue. In Ewing Township, about 150 residents were evacuated from the Willow Creek Rehabilitation and Care Center.  In Lawrence Township, six homes were badly damaged (condemned) by flood waters from the Delaware and Raritan Canal.  Businesses, car dealerships and residents near the Shabakunk Creek also suffered flood damage.  U.S. Route 1 buckled. In Princeton, schools were closed until Monday the 20th because of the combination of flood damage and water quality problems stemming from the Elizabethtown Water Company's Bridgewater treatment plant.  High winds took their toll also.  The chimney blew down onto the roof of the Imani Community Church. Pieces of the chimney crashed through the roof.  The replacement cost was estimated at 1 million dollars.

In Monmouth County, the worst flooding related problems occurred around noon EDT as the torrential rain coincided with the high tide. The worst flooding was reported in Union Beach and bay areas of Middletown Township. Mandatory evacuations occurred in Union Beach (which became an island) and voluntary evacuations occurred in Middletown Township along the bay and near Compton's and Pew Creeks. New Jersey State Routes 35 and 36 were closed due to flooding.  Farther inland, Manalapan Township was hardest hit with overflowing brooks that forced the closure of six roads and sandbagging of homes on Birmingham Road.  The strongest winds occurred during the evening and blew down transformers, wires, tree limbs and several trees throughout the county. Coastal areas escaped with minimal damage: just some minor beach erosion and minor back bay flooding at times of high tide. Thousands of barrels and drums (some containing hazardous solvents and acids) were found bobbing in the waters of Raritan and Sandy Hook Bays and washed ashore on local beaches.  
 
Across the southern half of New Jersey, the heaviest rain and the most widespread flooding occurred in townships along the Delaware River.  Less rain and flooding occurred farther southeast with less urban and poor drainage flooding and only minor beach erosion and back bay flooding reported in Atlantic, Cape May and Ocean Counties. The worst flooding occurred along some of the larger waterways in the area (Cooper River in Camden County, Rancocas Creek in Burlington County) and along tidal sections of tributaries to the Delaware River. This peaked during the evening high tide as winds funneled into the bay and brought higher tidal departures and slowed the discharge of inland waterways. The high tide in Philadelphia reached 9.4 feet above mean lower low water at around 640 p.m. EDT.  Moderate tidal flooding starts at 9.2 feet above mean lower low water. In Burlington County, some evacuations occurred in Riverside around the Delanco-Riverside Bridge.  The bridge was also closed.  Farther upstream along the Rancocas Creek the Centerton Bridge in Willingboro was closed.  Voluntary evacuations also occurred along the Delaware River in Delran and roads near the Rancocas Creek were closed.  Several evacuations also occurred along the Assicunk Creek in Burlington City.  Creek flooding (mainly the Rancocas) occurred in Medford, Mount Holly and Westampton Townships.  About 10 roads in the county were closed due to flooding.  In Camden County the worst flooding occurred in Collingswood along U.S. Route 130 between the Airport Circle and Collings Avenue.  Some homes were flooded and evacuated as raw sewage was present.  Flooding from Floyd knocked out a state psychiatric hospital's wastewater treatment plant in Winslow Township.  Downed trees damaged a home in Blackwood Township. In Gloucester County, about 40 persons were evacuated in Gibbstown after the Gibbstown Levee partially gave way and sent water from the Delaware River and Repaupo Creek into Gibbstown.  In adjacent Logan Township, about 20 persons were evacuated near Floodgate Road.  There were also additional voluntary evacuations in low-lying areas of both Logan and Monroe Townships. Sections of U.S. Route 130 were closed. One road collapsed in Woolwich Township and the torrential rain contributed to a fatal accident on the New Jersey Turnpike. In Salem County, tidal flooding occurred in Penns Grove.  A 40-year-old man died when he fell into the Salem near Pennsville.  Several dam failures occurred. In Cumberland County, 3,700 persons living in mobile home parks in Vineland were evacuated.  Farmers also feared that the heavy rain would ruin the fall spinach crop.  In Ocean County, elderly residents of Laurelton Gardens in Brick Township were evacuated after a creek flooded.  Scattered trees and wires were knocked down throughout the county.  A tree damaged a house in Toms River.

In Somerset County the Millstone River at Blackwells Mills crested at a RECORD BREAKING 21.0 feet at 345 a.m. EDT on the 17th. Flood stage is 9 feet and the river did not return to bankfull until 7p.m. EDT on the 18th. It was the first river to reach flood stage in the county at 1 p.m. EDT. Also in Somerset County, the North Branch of the Raritan River near Raritan crested at a RECORD BREAKING 18.8 feet at 11 p.m. EDT on the 16th.  Flood stage is 10 feet.  Farther downstream the Raritan River in Manville crested at a RECORD BREAKING 27.5 feet at midnight on the 17th.  Flood stage is nearly half as low, 14 feet.  In Bound Brook the Raritan River crested at a RECORD BREAKING 42.1 feet at 1030 p.m. EDT on the 16th. Flood stage is 28 feet.  The previous record set during Tropical Storm Doria was 37.5 feet set on August 28, 1971.  Flooding started at all of the three Raritan River points around 5 p.m. EDT.  Upstream in Hunterdon County, the South Branch of the Raritan River in High Bridge crested at 10.9 feet at Midnight EDT on the 17th.  Flood stage is 10 feet.  Farther downstream in Stanton, the South Branch of the Raritan River had its second highest crest on record, 13.9 feet at 8 p.m. EDT on the 16th. Flood stage is 8 feet.  In the Passaic River Basin in Morris County, the Rockaway River above the Boonton Reservoir crested at 6.3 feet at 1215 a.m. EDT on the 17th.  Flood stage is 5 feet. The Pompton River in Pompton Plains crested at its third highest ever at 21.0 feet at 3 a.m. EDT on the 17th. Flood stage is 16 feet.  Along the main stem of the Passaic River, along the Somerset County/Morris County border, in Millington the Passaic crested at 8.8 feet at 3 a.m. EDT on the 17th. The estimated flood stage is 8 feet. In Chatham (Morris County), the Passaic River crested at 7.6 feet at 530 p.m. EDT on the 17th.  Flood stage is 6 feet.  In Pine Brook (Morris County), the Passaic River crested at 20.8 feet at 9 a.m. EDT on the 18th.  Flood stage is estimated at 19 feet.  This point remained above its estimated flood stage the longest in the Passaic Basin, the river did not return to bankfull until 7 a.m. EDT on the 23rd.  In Mercer County, the Assunpink Creek in Trenton reached its 7 foot flood stage at 9 a.m. EDT on the 17th, the first gaged stream to hit flood stage that day.  It crested at 13.9 feet at 1 a.m. EDT on the 17th, the second highest crest on record. In Burlington County, the North Branch of the Rancocas Creek in Pemberton crested at 3.2 feet at 9 p.m. EDT on the 17th.  Flood stage is 2.7 feet.  In Camden County, the Cooper River at Haddonfield crested at 3.9 feet at 5 p.m. EDT on the 16th. Flood stage is 2.8 feet.  Highest reported wind gusts were 62 mph in Browns Mills (Burlington County), 58 mph at the Commodore Barry Bridge (Gloucester County), 52 mph in Luke's Bay (Atlantic County), Waretown (Ocean County) and Sandy Hook (Monmouth County), 47 mph in High Point (Sussex County), 44 mph in Trenton (Mercer County) and 40 mph in MIllville (Cumberland County).

The hurricane will go down in history as the greatest natural disaster to ever effect the state of New Jersey to date.  Preliminary damage estimates for the entire state were 1.1 billion dollars hitting Bergen and Somerset Counties the hardest. Manville and Bound Brook were hardest hit within Somerset County.  Six persons died in the state; all drownings: two each in Somerset and Bergen Counties, one in Passaic County and one in Salem County.  Hundreds were injured.  The hurricane caused record breaking flooding in the Raritan River Basin as storm totals averaged around ten inches. In spite of similar storm total amounts, the flooding in the Passaic River Basin did not exceed the record set in April of 1984, but reached as high as the third highest crest on record for some streams.  Excluding the northeast part of the state, storm totals elsewhere in the state ranged from three to ten inches with the highest amounts in Mercer County.  There were hundreds of rescues from creeks and trapped/submerged vehicles.  Many people ignored barricades and became stranded in flood waters. About 26,000 persons in the state were evacuated, about half of them in Somerset and Bergen Counties. Statewide 78 homes, 105 apartments (all in Somerset County) and 75 businesses were destroyed.  Statewide 3,900 homes, 1,208 apartments and 1,683 businesses suffered major damage defined as losing up to 50 percent of the property's value.  Statewide 23,235 homes, 1,758 apartments and 1,043 businesses suffered minor damage defined as suffering more than $10,000 in damage.  Statewide 39,113 homes, 2,232 apartments and 2,183 businesses suffered some damage defined as losing greater than $200 in damage. About 616,400 homes and businesses lost power throughout the state for up to five days.  About 17,800 homes and businesses, mainly around Somerset County, did not have gas service for up to two weeks.   About 500,000 persons in the Raritan Valley had to boil their water for eight days and not bathe as the flooding crippled the Elizabethtown Water Company's main water treatment plant in Bridgewater (Somerset County).  With the plant off line, water pressure was also low. Some municipalities received little, if any, water.  Other sewage treatment plants were so overwhelmed with runoff that many spewed raw sewage into the streams and rivers.  Schools were closed on the 16th as Governor Christie Whitman declared a state of emergency.  Service along Amtrak's Northeast Corridor was disrupted and not resumed until Saturday the 18th.  Service on several New Jersey Transit Lines was not resumed until the work week of the 20th.

A 40-year-old man drowned in the Salem River near Pennsville Township in Salem County.  An 85-year-old woman and her 58-year-old son drowned in Bound Brook (Somerset County) after they refused to evacuate and became trapped in their first floor apartment. The highest verifiable storm total was 14.45 inches in Pompton Lakes (Passaic County).  Nearby Philadelphia International Airport not only set a new daily precipitation record of  6.63 inches, but also a new 24 hour record of 6.77 inches. Based on SKYWARN Spotter reports and Doppler Radar precipitation estimates, the area of heaviest rain coincided with the first significant rise in elevation in the northern half of the state around the Watchung Mountains. Doppler storm total estimates of 10 to 12 inches covered much of the eastern half of Hunterdon County, the western half of Somerset County, extreme eastern parts of Morris County and adjacent areas in Essex, Passaic and Union Counties. Lesser amounts fell in the rest of northwest New Jersey.  Farther to the south, storm totals increased farther west in New Jersey with locations along the Delaware River receiving the heaviest amounts.  Doppler Radar storm total estimates reached 10 inches in Salem and Mercer Counties. The torrential downpours associated with Hurricane Floyd exceeded the 100-year-flood return period in the Raritan Basin as several rivers and streams either set record or had their second highest crest on record.  The combination of winds funneling into the Delaware Bay and the Delaware River and the record runoff from inland waterways produced minor to moderate tidal flooding at the times of high tide in Cumberland, Salem, Gloucester, Camden and Burlington Counties.  Evacuations occurred in low-lying areas near the river.  The evening (16th) high tide also slowed the discharge of streams into the Delaware.  The highest wind gusts were mainly less than 60 mph.  But, the combination of the heavy rain that loosened the ground and the persistence of the strong winds uprooted hundreds of trees.  President Clinton declared Bergen, Essex, Mercer, Middlesex, Morris, Passaic, Somerset and Union Counties a disaster area.  Homeowners in Hunterdon County were also eligible for damage assistance. 

Hurricane Floyd began as a Cape Verde type hurricane east of the Lesser Antilles.  As Floyd moved west, it passed to the north of and spared both the Greater and Lesser Antilles.  Floyd intensified into a Category IV (Major) Hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Scale.  Floyd was a large sized hurricane that  prolonged both the torrential rain and high winds.  Floyd was heading for Florida before a turn to the northwest spared the state, but Floyd battered the Bahamas.  The anticipated turn to the north and the northeast occurred on the 15th as Floyd was heading for North Carolina.  Another important synoptic feature was a cold front that was over West Virginia on the 14th.  This front stalled in Eastern Pennsylvania on the 15th.  The stalled front not only failed to push offshore an already tropical and humid air mass that was over the state, but also acted as a conduit for the tropical moisture associated with Floyd.  The moisture headed west toward the front, rising upward and dropped the heaviest rain in upslope areas of the state.  Light rain associated with Floyd started in the state on the 15th.  The torrential rain associated with Floyd arrived around 3 a.m. EDT in the southern part of the state and spread into Sussex County  by 10 a.m. EDT.  Floyd was just making landfall at the Mouth of Cape Fear or Bald Head Island in North Carolina as the heavy rain reached Mount Holly. Floyd started to accelerate northeast during the morning of the 16th.  Some gusty winds arrived in the state during the morning of the 16th.  A weakened (with respect to wind) Category One Floyd moved through Virginia Beach, Virginia and was back over the open Atlantic Ocean around noon on the 16th.  Floyd continued to move northeast and the eye passed just east of the Virginia Capes and Fenwick Island, Delaware around 3 p.m. EDT.  By the afternoon of the 16th all the torrential rain had moved north of Floyd and ended with the passage of the hurricane (on the same latitude line).  During the afternoon of the 16th all of the sustained hurricane force winds were located over the Atlantic. At 5 p.m. EDT Floyd was downgraded to a tropical storm as it passed about 10 miles east of Atlantic City.  Between 5 p.m. and 9 p.m. EDT the torrential rain ended across the state from south to north.  The strongest winds associated with Floyd mixed down as cooler air behind the system moved into the region.   For many locations the strongest wind gusts occurred between 4 p.m. and 10 p.m. EDT and the highest gusts occurred over higher terrain locations. Wind gusts rarely exceeded 50 mph, but all the flooding rains made it easier for trees to be knocked over.  Tropical Storm Floyd made landfall again on western Fire Island in Suffolk County,  New York around 8 p.m. EDT and was located near Portland, Maine at 8 a.m. EDT on the 17th. 
 
Somerset County and Bound Brook and Manville specifically were hit the hardest (in the Mount Holly, NJ area of forecast and warning responsibility).  Expressions such as "It's gone.", "It's totaled.", "It's like nothing we've seen before." were used to describe the flooding in downtown Bound Brook.  About 2,000 persons were evacuated, 800 were rescued from second story windows and rooftops in the downtown and west end areas. The downtown was covered by an estimated thirteen feet of water. Flooding stretched from Tea Street to Billian-Legion Park and reached as high as High Street.  Due to an electrical malfunction, a fire broke out in a cluster of stores on Main Street in Bound Brook.  Flood waters prevented firefighters from getting close.  Four stores were gutted, three others were heavily damaged. Borough schools were closed through the 24th.  Main Street was not reopened until October 5th. More than 200 homes were condemned.  Manville was hit equally as hard as 1,000 persons were evacuated from 360 homes in the Lost Valley section.  In all 1,500 homes were damaged and 284 homes were condemned.  The mud line was 10 feet above ground level. Both boroughs are along the Raritan River and the Raritan set new record crests at both locations breaking the previous record set during Tropical Storm Doria on August 28, 1971. Flood waters from the Raritan River also inundated the Elizabethtown Water Company's main water treatment plant in Bridgewater.  About 500,000 customers in Hunterdon, Mercer, Middlesex and Somerset Counties were forced to boil their water and advised not to bathe.  The plant tripping off line also produced low water pressure that affected numerous municipalities. The National Guard delivered more than 500,000 bottles of water. The plant started to pump some water on Monday the 20th, was back to one-third of capacity on the 23rd and cancelled the boiling advisory at 8 p.m. EDT on the 24th.  Many schools and businesses could not open until an adequate and safe water supply returned.  Flooding along the Green Brook pushed up to three feet of sewage contaminated flood waters into the first floor of Green Brook Township's Municipal Building.  In Hillsborough Township 600 homes were damaged and 200 persons were evacuated along the Millstone and Neshanic Rivers. A rescue boat capsized while trying to rescue a man trapped in a tree for two hours.  In Franklin Township, flood waters from the Raritan River reached 10 feet inside the buildings of the Zarapeth Community Church destroying 20,000 volumes of books in its Bible Institute. Damage here alone was estimated at 2.5 million dollars.  Nearly every township had flooded roads and low-lying area evacuations.  Many townships were effectively cut-off. Downed trees exacerbated the damage mainly in the northern part of the county. Seventy-five percent of all the bridges in the county were damaged.  Eight bridges remained closed in Bedminster, Bound Brook, Hillsborough and Montgomery.  Several of them were damaged from logs smashing into them.  Four bridges remained closed on October 19th.  Numerous waterways were contaminated with raw sewage, heating oil and other pollutants.  A 58-year-old building inspector became ill with Legionnaire's Disease during the clean-up.  About 4,400 persons were evacuated throughout the county, 60 persons were still in shelters on October 15th.  Many businesses in downtown Bound Brook and Manville were not expected to reopen.   

Farther downstream in Middlesex County the Raritan River flooding also took its toll.  As the Raritan River was rising, the incoming high tide during the early morning of the 17th prevented it from discharging into the bay.  Around the time of this high tide, the Raritan River caused the worst flooding in memory in Middlesex County.  About 3,300 persons were sheltered as evacuations occurred in New Brunswick, Carteret, Dunellen, Edison, South Brunswick, South Plainfield and Woodbridge. In New Brunswick the Raritan river flooded over New Jersey State Route 18. Flood waters cascaded around the New Brunswick Homes and River Watch Apartment Complexes (about 1,000 persons were evacuated), the New Brunswick Police Department and the New Brunswick Municipal Court.  Neither of the municipal buildings were used again. New Jersey State Route 18 opened the afternoon of the 18th.  Three bridges were closed. The Delaware and Raritan Canal Locks, swing bridge and tow path were damaged.  Severe flooding damage was reported in Highland Park, Middlesex Borough, Piscataway,  South Plainfield and Woodbridge.  In Middlesex Borough  500 homes were damaged and the damage estimate was 6 million dollars.  In Woodbridge, flooded stores were not expected to be reopened for weeks.  In Piscataway where damage estimates reached 5 million dollars, the Riverside, Mayflower and Birchview Apartment Complexes were severely flooded. Parks near the Raritan River were also badly damaged. In Edison, low water pressure problems associated with the Elizabethtown Water Treatment Plant resulted in little or no water for the township through the 20th.  The National Guard was providing water.  Numerous streams flooded throughout the county.  By early afternoon 30 to 40 roads throughout the county were already closed with numerous water rescues from car tops taking place.  Rutgers University canceled classes on both the 16th and 17th.  Downed trees were reported in Metuchen and over 100 homes were damaged by flooding in Dunellen.  Another affect of Floyd was the thousands of barrels and drums (some containing hazardous solvents and acids) were found bobbing in the waters of Raritan and Sandy Hook Bays and washed ashore on local beaches.        

Upstream areas in the Raritan Basin did not fare much better.  In Hunterdon County five homes were destroyed, 117 had major damage and 582 had minor damage.  Two apartments suffered major damage and 7 suffered minor damage. Twenty-four businesses also were damaged.  About 125 persons were evacuated. Five percent of all county roads were damaged and three bridges (In East Amwell, Franklin and Readington Townships) were expected to remain closed through mid November.   Hardest hit was Lambertville, especially the south side of the city near Swan Creek.  Nearly 100 homes were flooded and half the evacuations within the county occurred in this city.  The flooding creek also cracked a water pipe leaving the south side of the city with no water.  Elsewhere the elementary school was flooded with nearly two feet of water (damage estimate 1.1 million) as a creek behind the school overflowed.  The school did not reopen until Tuesday September 28th.  Other streams and rivers flooded in Alexandria, Califon, Frenchtown and Holland Townships.  High winds also damaged two homes in Holland Township and vehicles in Frenchtown Borough.

Elsewhere in Northwest New Jersey, Morris County in the Passaic Basin was hit hard.  It was one of the hardest hit counties with respect to wind damage in the state.  Hundreds of trees were knocked down.  About 1,500 persons were evacuated because of flooding.  Numerous roads were closed including NJ State Routes 10 and 23, U.S. Route 46 and NJ State Route 53.  The hardest hit municipalities were Pequannock and Lincoln Park along the Pompton River.  Flooding caused an estimated 5.5 million dollars to two hundred fifty homes in Pequannock.  One home collapsed and trapped two persons and a dog inside.  They were rescued.  Thirty-five roads alone in Pequannock were closed. Flooding along the Rockaway River caused evacuations in Denville and Dover. Three hundred homes were flooded in Dover.  Flooding along the Whippany River forced the evacuation of 50 families in Morristown and closed 15 roads in Mendham Township. Serious flooding also occurred along the South Branch of the Raritan River in Washington Township, the Loantanka Brook in Harding Township and Terrace Lake in Butler Borough.  Flooding caused the Allen Street Bridge to collapse in Netcong Borough. Numerous trees were knocked down in Boonton, Harding, Mendham, Netcong and Washington Townships.  Dozens of homes were damaged by the fallen trees.  In Mendham Township, 100 foot tall oak trees were snapped.  In Harding Township, 90 percent of the township lost power because of downed trees.  Every house on one block of Millbrook Road had downed trees on it.  School were closed through Friday the 17th throughout most of the county and New Jersey Transit Rail Service was not returned to full operations until Monday the 20th.

On a relative basis the effects of Floyd diminished across Warren and Sussex Counties.  In Franklin Township in Warren County a trailer exploded after flood waters caused a short in the wiring of a propane stove and spread to the tanks outside.  The trailer exploded, but no one was hurt since the trailer park was already evacuated because of flooding.   About 38,000 homes and businesses lost power.  Power was not fully restored until the 21st. Hardest hit were Byram Township, Frankford Township, Hopatcong Borough and the town of Newton.  Flooding caused by Floyd contaminated municipal wells in Andover and Hampton Townships. 

In Central New Jersey, Mercer County was hit the hardest and was also included in the disaster declaration. About 400 persons were evacuated in Ewing and Lawrence Townships and in Trenton.  About 85 major roads were closed including sections of Interstate 95, U.S. Routes 1 and 130 and New Jersey State Route 33. Hundreds of water rescues from trapped vehicles occurred. In Trenton the worst flood damage occurred along the Assunpink Creek.  Forty homes and three businesses were damaged on Mulberry Street, Dickinson Street and North Clinton Avenue. In Ewing Township, about 150 residents were evacuated from the Willow Creek Rehabilitation and Care Center.  In Lawrence Township, six homes were badly damaged (condemned) by flood waters from the Delaware and Raritan Canal.  Businesses, car dealerships and residents near the Shabakunk Creek also suffered flood damage.  U.S. Route 1 buckled. In Princeton, schools were closed until Monday the 20th because of the combination of flood damage and water quality problems stemming from the Elizabethtown Water Company's Bridgewater treatment plant.  High winds took their toll also.  The chimney blew down onto the roof of the Imani Community Church. Pieces of the chimney crashed through the roof.  The replacement cost was estimated at 1 million dollars.

In Monmouth County, the worst flooding related problems occurred around noon EDT as the torrential rain coincided with the high tide. The worst flooding was reported in Union Beach and bay areas of Middletown Township. Mandatory evacuations occurred in Union Beach (which became an island) and voluntary evacuations occurred in Middletown Township along the bay and near Compton's and Pew Creeks. New Jersey State Routes 35 and 36 were closed due to flooding.  Farther inland, Manalapan Township was hardest hit with overflowing brooks that forced the closure of six roads and sandbagging of homes on Birmingham Road.  The strongest winds occurred during the evening and blew down transformers, wires, tree limbs and several trees throughout the county. Coastal areas escaped with minimal damage: just some minor beach erosion and minor back bay flooding at times of high tide. Thousands of barrels and drums (some containing hazardous solvents and acids) were found bobbing in the waters of Raritan and Sandy Hook Bays and washed ashore on local beaches.  
 
Across the southern half of New Jersey, the heaviest rain and the most widespread flooding occurred in townships along the Delaware River.  Less rain and flooding occurred farther southeast with less urban and poor drainage flooding and only minor beach erosion and back bay flooding reported in Atlantic, Cape May and Ocean Counties. The worst flooding occurred along some of the larger waterways in the area (Cooper River in Camden County, Rancocas Creek in Burlington County) and along tidal sections of tributaries to the Delaware River. This peaked during the evening high tide as winds funneled into the bay and brought higher tidal departures and slowed the discharge of inland waterways. The high tide in Philadelphia reached 9.4 feet above mean lower low water at around 640 p.m. EDT.  Moderate tidal flooding starts at 9.2 feet above mean lower low water. In Burlington County, some evacuations occurred in Riverside around the Delanco-Riverside Bridge.  The bridge was also closed.  Farther upstream along the Rancocas Creek the Centerton Bridge in Willingboro was closed.  Voluntary evacuations also occurred along the Delaware River in Delran and roads near the Rancocas Creek were closed.  Several evacuations also occurred along the Assicunk Creek in Burlington City.  Creek flooding (mainly the Rancocas) occurred in Medford, Mount Holly and Westampton Townships.  About 10 roads in the county were closed due to flooding.  In Camden County the worst flooding occurred in Collingswood along U.S. Route 130 between the Airport Circle and Collings Avenue.  Some homes were flooded and evacuated as raw sewage was present.  Flooding from Floyd knocked out a state psychiatric hospital's wastewater treatment plant in Winslow Township.  Downed trees damaged a home in Blackwood Township. In Gloucester County, about 40 persons were evacuated in Gibbstown after the Gibbstown Levee partially gave way and sent water from the Delaware River and Repaupo Creek into Gibbstown.  In adjacent Logan Township, about 20 persons were evacuated near Floodgate Road.  There were also additional voluntary evacuations in low-lying areas of both Logan and Monroe Townships. Sections of U.S. Route 130 were closed. One road collapsed in Woolwich Township and the torrential rain contributed to a fatal accident on the New Jersey Turnpike. In Salem County, tidal flooding occurred in Penns Grove.  A 40-year-old man died when he fell into the Salem near Pennsville.  Several dam failures occurred. In Cumberland County, 3,700 persons living in mobile home parks in Vineland were evacuated.  Farmers also feared that the heavy rain would ruin the fall spinach crop.  In Ocean County, elderly residents of Laurelton Gardens in Brick Township were evacuated after a creek flooded.  Scattered trees and wires were knocked down throughout the county.  A tree damaged a house in Toms River.
