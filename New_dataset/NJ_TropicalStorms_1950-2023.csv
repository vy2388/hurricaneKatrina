Hurricane Bertha made landfall near Wilmington North Carolina close to 5 p.m. EDT on the 12th and moved northnortheast overnight.  At 11 p.m. EDT it was 100 miles southwest of Norfolk, at 3 a.m. EDT on the 13th it was 45 miles westsouthwest of Norfolk, at 8 a.m. EDT it was 45 miles south of Dover, at 930 a.m. EDT it was in extreme northeastern Sussex County Delaware, at 11 a.m. EDT it was near Atlantic City and at 5 p.m. EDT it was over eastern Long Island Sound.

One storm related death occurred on the 12th.  A 41-year-old man from New Egypt drowned while surfing at Ocean Beach.  Most beaches were already closed due to the rough surf and the potential for rip tides.  During the morning of the 13th three Lavallette firefighters were rescued in Barnegat Bay after a one hour search.  They rescued a Lavallette man who was trying to tie down his boat. It was ripped away from its mooring and began drifting into the bay.  They returned him to the shore, but when they tried to retrieve his boat, the rescue boat's propulsion system became tangled by rope.       

While the long trip over land did weaken it, some wind related damage did occur.  Wind gusts reached 63 mph in Harvey Cedars, 60 mph in Seaside Park, 55 mph in Cumberland County and 43 mph at Atlantic City International Airport in Pomona.  Most of the strongest winds occurred between 6 a.m. and noon EDT.  About 40,000 Atlantic Electric customers lost power.  Downed wires closed Second Street in Cape May City.  Some minor back bay tidal flooding occurred in Cape May County.  Otherwise tidal departures were about two feet or less from normal.  Only Monmouth Beach suffered severe beach erosion.  Sixty feet of the one hundred twenty foot wide beach at the south of the borough was gone.  This beach is one of dozens in New Jersey that was being replenished under a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers project.  There was little beach erosion elsewhere.  Some of the heaviest rains with Bertha fell near or along the coast which included 6.59 inches in Estelle Manor, 4.56 inches in Folsom, 4.14 inches in Belleplain, 4.00 inches in Cape May County Courthouse, 3.78 inches in Hammonton and 2.07 inches in Margate.

The hurricane will go down in history as the greatest natural disaster to ever effect the state of New Jersey to date.  Preliminary damage estimates for the entire state were 1.1 billion dollars hitting Bergen and Somerset Counties the hardest. Manville and Bound Brook were hardest hit within Somerset County.  Six persons died in the state; all drownings: two each in Somerset and Bergen Counties, one in Passaic County and one in Salem County.  Hundreds were injured.  The hurricane caused record breaking flooding in the Raritan River Basin as storm totals averaged around ten inches. In spite of similar storm total amounts, the flooding in the Passaic River Basin did not exceed the record set in April of 1984, but reached as high as the third highest crest on record for some streams.  Excluding the northeast part of the state, storm totals elsewhere in the state ranged from three to ten inches with the highest amounts in Mercer County.  There were hundreds of rescues from creeks and trapped/submerged vehicles.  Many people ignored barricades and became stranded in flood waters. About 26,000 persons in the state were evacuated, about half of them in Somerset and Bergen Counties. Statewide 78 homes, 105 apartments (all in Somerset County) and 75 businesses were destroyed.  Statewide 3,900 homes, 1,208 apartments and 1,683 businesses suffered major damage defined as losing up to 50 percent of the property's value.  Statewide 23,235 homes, 1,758 apartments and 1,043 businesses suffered minor damage defined as suffering more than $10,000 in damage.  Statewide 39,113 homes, 2,232 apartments and 2,183 businesses suffered some damage defined as losing greater than $200 in damage. About 616,400 homes and businesses lost power throughout the state for up to five days.  About 17,800 homes and businesses, mainly around Somerset County, did not have gas service for up to two weeks.   About 500,000 persons in the Raritan Valley had to boil their water for eight days and not bathe as the flooding crippled the Elizabethtown Water Company's main water treatment plant in Bridgewater (Somerset County).  With the plant off line, water pressure was also low. Some municipalities received little, if any, water.  Other sewage treatment plants were so overwhelmed with runoff that many spewed raw sewage into the streams and rivers.  Schools were closed on the 16th as Governor Christie Whitman declared a state of emergency.  Service along Amtrak's Northeast Corridor was disrupted and not resumed until Saturday the 18th.  Service on several New Jersey Transit Lines was not resumed until the work week of the 20th.

A 40-year-old man drowned in the Salem River near Pennsville Township in Salem County.  An 85-year-old woman and her 58-year-old son drowned in Bound Brook (Somerset County) after they refused to evacuate and became trapped in their first floor apartment. The highest verifiable storm total was 14.45 inches in Pompton Lakes (Passaic County).  Nearby Philadelphia International Airport not only set a new daily precipitation record of  6.63 inches, but also a new 24 hour record of 6.77 inches. Based on SKYWARN Spotter reports and Doppler Radar precipitation estimates, the area of heaviest rain coincided with the first significant rise in elevation in the northern half of the state around the Watchung Mountains. Doppler storm total estimates of 10 to 12 inches covered much of the eastern half of Hunterdon County, the western half of Somerset County, extreme eastern parts of Morris County and adjacent areas in Essex, Passaic and Union Counties. Lesser amounts fell in the rest of northwest New Jersey.  Farther to the south, storm totals increased farther west in New Jersey with locations along the Delaware River receiving the heaviest amounts.  Doppler Radar storm total estimates reached 10 inches in Salem and Mercer Counties. The torrential downpours associated with Hurricane Floyd exceeded the 100-year-flood return period in the Raritan Basin as several rivers and streams either set record or had their second highest crest on record.  The combination of winds funneling into the Delaware Bay and the Delaware River and the record runoff from inland waterways produced minor to moderate tidal flooding at the times of high tide in Cumberland, Salem, Gloucester, Camden and Burlington Counties.  Evacuations occurred in low-lying areas near the river.  The evening (16th) high tide also slowed the discharge of streams into the Delaware.  The highest wind gusts were mainly less than 60 mph.  But, the combination of the heavy rain that loosened the ground and the persistence of the strong winds uprooted hundreds of trees.  President Clinton declared Bergen, Essex, Mercer, Middlesex, Morris, Passaic, Somerset and Union Counties a disaster area.  Homeowners in Hunterdon County were also eligible for damage assistance. 

Hurricane Floyd began as a Cape Verde type hurricane east of the Lesser Antilles.  As Floyd moved west, it passed to the north of and spared both the Greater and Lesser Antilles.  Floyd intensified into a Category IV (Major) Hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Scale.  Floyd was a large sized hurricane that  prolonged both the torrential rain and high winds.  Floyd was heading for Florida before a turn to the northwest spared the state, but Floyd battered the Bahamas.  The anticipated turn to the north and the northeast occurred on the 15th as Floyd was heading for North Carolina.  Another important synoptic feature was a cold front that was over West Virginia on the 14th.  This front stalled in Eastern Pennsylvania on the 15th.  The stalled front not only failed to push offshore an already tropical and humid air mass that was over the state, but also acted as a conduit for the tropical moisture associated with Floyd.  The moisture headed west toward the front, rising upward and dropped the heaviest rain in upslope areas of the state.  Light rain associated with Floyd started in the state on the 15th.  The torrential rain associated with Floyd arrived around 3 a.m. EDT in the southern part of the state and spread into Sussex County  by 10 a.m. EDT.  Floyd was just making landfall at the Mouth of Cape Fear or Bald Head Island in North Carolina as the heavy rain reached Mount Holly. Floyd started to accelerate northeast during the morning of the 16th.  Some gusty winds arrived in the state during the morning of the 16th.  A weakened (with respect to wind) Category One Floyd moved through Virginia Beach, Virginia and was back over the open Atlantic Ocean around noon on the 16th.  Floyd continued to move northeast and the eye passed just east of the Virginia Capes and Fenwick Island, Delaware around 3 p.m. EDT.  By the afternoon of the 16th all the torrential rain had moved north of Floyd and ended with the passage of the hurricane (on the same latitude line).  During the afternoon of the 16th all of the sustained hurricane force winds were located over the Atlantic. At 5 p.m. EDT Floyd was downgraded to a tropical storm as it passed about 10 miles east of Atlantic City.  Between 5 p.m. and 9 p.m. EDT the torrential rain ended across the state from south to north.  The strongest winds associated with Floyd mixed down as cooler air behind the system moved into the region.   For many locations the strongest wind gusts occurred between 4 p.m. and 10 p.m. EDT and the highest gusts occurred over higher terrain locations. Wind gusts rarely exceeded 50 mph, but all the flooding rains made it easier for trees to be knocked over.  Tropical Storm Floyd made landfall again on western Fire Island in Suffolk County,  New York around 8 p.m. EDT and was located near Portland, Maine at 8 a.m. EDT on the 17th. 
 
Somerset County and Bound Brook and Manville specifically were hit the hardest (in the Mount Holly, NJ area of forecast and warning responsibility).  Expressions such as "It's gone.", "It's totaled.", "It's like nothing we've seen before." were used to describe the flooding in downtown Bound Brook.  About 2,000 persons were evacuated, 800 were rescued from second story windows and rooftops in the downtown and west end areas. The downtown was covered by an estimated thirteen feet of water. Flooding stretched from Tea Street to Billian-Legion Park and reached as high as High Street.  Due to an electrical malfunction, a fire broke out in a cluster of stores on Main Street in Bound Brook.  Flood waters prevented firefighters from getting close.  Four stores were gutted, three others were heavily damaged. Borough schools were closed through the 24th.  Main Street was not reopened until October 5th. More than 200 homes were condemned.  Manville was hit equally as hard as 1,000 persons were evacuated from 360 homes in the Lost Valley section.  In all 1,500 homes were damaged and 284 homes were condemned.  The mud line was 10 feet above ground level. Both boroughs are along the Raritan River and the Raritan set new record crests at both locations breaking the previous record set during Tropical Storm Doria on August 28, 1971. Flood waters from the Raritan River also inundated the Elizabethtown Water Company's main water treatment plant in Bridgewater.  About 500,000 customers in Hunterdon, Mercer, Middlesex and Somerset Counties were forced to boil their water and advised not to bathe.  The plant tripping off line also produced low water pressure that affected numerous municipalities. The National Guard delivered more than 500,000 bottles of water. The plant started to pump some water on Monday the 20th, was back to one-third of capacity on the 23rd and cancelled the boiling advisory at 8 p.m. EDT on the 24th.  Many schools and businesses could not open until an adequate and safe water supply returned.  Flooding along the Green Brook pushed up to three feet of sewage contaminated flood waters into the first floor of Green Brook Township's Municipal Building.  In Hillsborough Township 600 homes were damaged and 200 persons were evacuated along the Millstone and Neshanic Rivers. A rescue boat capsized while trying to rescue a man trapped in a tree for two hours.  In Franklin Township, flood waters from the Raritan River reached 10 feet inside the buildings of the Zarapeth Community Church destroying 20,000 volumes of books in its Bible Institute. Damage here alone was estimated at 2.5 million dollars.  Nearly every township had flooded roads and low-lying area evacuations.  Many townships were effectively cut-off. Downed trees exacerbated the damage mainly in the northern part of the county. Seventy-five percent of all the bridges in the county were damaged.  Eight bridges remained closed in Bedminster, Bound Brook, Hillsborough and Montgomery.  Several of them were damaged from logs smashing into them.  Four bridges remained closed on October 19th.  Numerous waterways were contaminated with raw sewage, heating oil and other pollutants.  A 58-year-old building inspector became ill with Legionnaire's Disease during the clean-up.  About 4,400 persons were evacuated throughout the county, 60 persons were still in shelters on October 15th.  Many businesses in downtown Bound Brook and Manville were not expected to reopen.   

Farther downstream in Middlesex County the Raritan River flooding also took its toll.  As the Raritan River was rising, the incoming high tide during the early morning of the 17th prevented it from discharging into the bay.  Around the time of this high tide, the Raritan River caused the worst flooding in memory in Middlesex County.  About 3,300 persons were sheltered as evacuations occurred in New Brunswick, Carteret, Dunellen, Edison, South Brunswick, South Plainfield and Woodbridge. In New Brunswick the Raritan river flooded over New Jersey State Route 18. Flood waters cascaded around the New Brunswick Homes and River Watch Apartment Complexes (about 1,000 persons were evacuated), the New Brunswick Police Department and the New Brunswick Municipal Court.  Neither of the municipal buildings were used again. New Jersey State Route 18 opened the afternoon of the 18th.  Three bridges were closed. The Delaware and Raritan Canal Locks, swing bridge and tow path were damaged.  Severe flooding damage was reported in Highland Park, Middlesex Borough, Piscataway,  South Plainfield and Woodbridge.  In Middlesex Borough  500 homes were damaged and the damage estimate was 6 million dollars.  In Woodbridge, flooded stores were not expected to be reopened for weeks.  In Piscataway where damage estimates reached 5 million dollars, the Riverside, Mayflower and Birchview Apartment Complexes were severely flooded. Parks near the Raritan River were also badly damaged. In Edison, low water pressure problems associated with the Elizabethtown Water Treatment Plant resulted in little or no water for the township through the 20th.  The National Guard was providing water.  Numerous streams flooded throughout the county.  By early afternoon 30 to 40 roads throughout the county were already closed with numerous water rescues from car tops taking place.  Rutgers University canceled classes on both the 16th and 17th.  Downed trees were reported in Metuchen and over 100 homes were damaged by flooding in Dunellen.  Another affect of Floyd was the thousands of barrels and drums (some containing hazardous solvents and acids) were found bobbing in the waters of Raritan and Sandy Hook Bays and washed ashore on local beaches.        

Upstream areas in the Raritan Basin did not fare much better.  In Hunterdon County five homes were destroyed, 117 had major damage and 582 had minor damage.  Two apartments suffered major damage and 7 suffered minor damage. Twenty-four businesses also were damaged.  About 125 persons were evacuated. Five percent of all county roads were damaged and three bridges (In East Amwell, Franklin and Readington Townships) were expected to remain closed through mid November.   Hardest hit was Lambertville, especially the south side of the city near Swan Creek.  Nearly 100 homes were flooded and half the evacuations within the county occurred in this city.  The flooding creek also cracked a water pipe leaving the south side of the city with no water.  Elsewhere the elementary school was flooded with nearly two feet of water (damage estimate 1.1 million) as a creek behind the school overflowed.  The school did not reopen until Tuesday September 28th.  Other streams and rivers flooded in Alexandria, Califon, Frenchtown and Holland Townships.  High winds also damaged two homes in Holland Township and vehicles in Frenchtown Borough.

Elsewhere in Northwest New Jersey, Morris County in the Passaic Basin was hit hard.  It was one of the hardest hit counties with respect to wind damage in the state.  Hundreds of trees were knocked down.  About 1,500 persons were evacuated because of flooding.  Numerous roads were closed including NJ State Routes 10 and 23, U.S. Route 46 and NJ State Route 53.  The hardest hit municipalities were Pequannock and Lincoln Park along the Pompton River.  Flooding caused an estimated 5.5 million dollars to two hundred fifty homes in Pequannock.  One home collapsed and trapped two persons and a dog inside.  They were rescued.  Thirty-five roads alone in Pequannock were closed. Flooding along the Rockaway River caused evacuations in Denville and Dover. Three hundred homes were flooded in Dover.  Flooding along the Whippany River forced the evacuation of 50 families in Morristown and closed 15 roads in Mendham Township. Serious flooding also occurred along the South Branch of the Raritan River in Washington Township, the Loantanka Brook in Harding Township and Terrace Lake in Butler Borough.  Flooding caused the Allen Street Bridge to collapse in Netcong Borough. Numerous trees were knocked down in Boonton, Harding, Mendham, Netcong and Washington Townships.  Dozens of homes were damaged by the fallen trees.  In Mendham Township, 100 foot tall oak trees were snapped.  In Harding Township, 90 percent of the township lost power because of downed trees.  Every house on one block of Millbrook Road had downed trees on it.  School were closed through Friday the 17th throughout most of the county and New Jersey Transit Rail Service was not returned to full operations until Monday the 20th.

On a relative basis the effects of Floyd diminished across Warren and Sussex Counties.  In Franklin Township in Warren County a trailer exploded after flood waters caused a short in the wiring of a propane stove and spread to the tanks outside.  The trailer exploded, but no one was hurt since the trailer park was already evacuated because of flooding.   About 38,000 homes and businesses lost power.  Power was not fully restored until the 21st. Hardest hit were Byram Township, Frankford Township, Hopatcong Borough and the town of Newton.  Flooding caused by Floyd contaminated municipal wells in Andover and Hampton Townships. 

In Central New Jersey, Mercer County was hit the hardest and was also included in the disaster declaration. About 400 persons were evacuated in Ewing and Lawrence Townships and in Trenton.  About 85 major roads were closed including sections of Interstate 95, U.S. Routes 1 and 130 and New Jersey State Route 33. Hundreds of water rescues from trapped vehicles occurred. In Trenton the worst flood damage occurred along the Assunpink Creek.  Forty homes and three businesses were damaged on Mulberry Street, Dickinson Street and North Clinton Avenue. In Ewing Township, about 150 residents were evacuated from the Willow Creek Rehabilitation and Care Center.  In Lawrence Township, six homes were badly damaged (condemned) by flood waters from the Delaware and Raritan Canal.  Businesses, car dealerships and residents near the Shabakunk Creek also suffered flood damage.  U.S. Route 1 buckled. In Princeton, schools were closed until Monday the 20th because of the combination of flood damage and water quality problems stemming from the Elizabethtown Water Company's Bridgewater treatment plant.  High winds took their toll also.  The chimney blew down onto the roof of the Imani Community Church. Pieces of the chimney crashed through the roof.  The replacement cost was estimated at 1 million dollars.

In Monmouth County, the worst flooding related problems occurred around noon EDT as the torrential rain coincided with the high tide. The worst flooding was reported in Union Beach and bay areas of Middletown Township. Mandatory evacuations occurred in Union Beach (which became an island) and voluntary evacuations occurred in Middletown Township along the bay and near Compton's and Pew Creeks. New Jersey State Routes 35 and 36 were closed due to flooding.  Farther inland, Manalapan Township was hardest hit with overflowing brooks that forced the closure of six roads and sandbagging of homes on Birmingham Road.  The strongest winds occurred during the evening and blew down transformers, wires, tree limbs and several trees throughout the county. Coastal areas escaped with minimal damage: just some minor beach erosion and minor back bay flooding at times of high tide. Thousands of barrels and drums (some containing hazardous solvents and acids) were found bobbing in the waters of Raritan and Sandy Hook Bays and washed ashore on local beaches.  
 
Across the southern half of New Jersey, the heaviest rain and the most widespread flooding occurred in townships along the Delaware River.  Less rain and flooding occurred farther southeast with less urban and poor drainage flooding and only minor beach erosion and back bay flooding reported in Atlantic, Cape May and Ocean Counties. The worst flooding occurred along some of the larger waterways in the area (Cooper River in Camden County, Rancocas Creek in Burlington County) and along tidal sections of tributaries to the Delaware River. This peaked during the evening high tide as winds funneled into the bay and brought higher tidal departures and slowed the discharge of inland waterways. The high tide in Philadelphia reached 9.4 feet above mean lower low water at around 640 p.m. EDT.  Moderate tidal flooding starts at 9.2 feet above mean lower low water. In Burlington County, some evacuations occurred in Riverside around the Delanco-Riverside Bridge.  The bridge was also closed.  Farther upstream along the Rancocas Creek the Centerton Bridge in Willingboro was closed.  Voluntary evacuations also occurred along the Delaware River in Delran and roads near the Rancocas Creek were closed.  Several evacuations also occurred along the Assicunk Creek in Burlington City.  Creek flooding (mainly the Rancocas) occurred in Medford, Mount Holly and Westampton Townships.  About 10 roads in the county were closed due to flooding.  In Camden County the worst flooding occurred in Collingswood along U.S. Route 130 between the Airport Circle and Collings Avenue.  Some homes were flooded and evacuated as raw sewage was present.  Flooding from Floyd knocked out a state psychiatric hospital's wastewater treatment plant in Winslow Township.  Downed trees damaged a home in Blackwood Township. In Gloucester County, about 40 persons were evacuated in Gibbstown after the Gibbstown Levee partially gave way and sent water from the Delaware River and Repaupo Creek into Gibbstown.  In adjacent Logan Township, about 20 persons were evacuated near Floodgate Road.  There were also additional voluntary evacuations in low-lying areas of both Logan and Monroe Townships. Sections of U.S. Route 130 were closed. One road collapsed in Woolwich Township and the torrential rain contributed to a fatal accident on the New Jersey Turnpike. In Salem County, tidal flooding occurred in Penns Grove.  A 40-year-old man died when he fell into the Salem near Pennsville.  Several dam failures occurred. In Cumberland County, 3,700 persons living in mobile home parks in Vineland were evacuated.  Farmers also feared that the heavy rain would ruin the fall spinach crop.  In Ocean County, elderly residents of Laurelton Gardens in Brick Township were evacuated after a creek flooded.  Scattered trees and wires were knocked down throughout the county.  A tree damaged a house in Toms River.

In Somerset County the Millstone River at Blackwells Mills crested at a RECORD BREAKING 21.0 feet at 345 a.m. EDT on the 17th. Flood stage is 9 feet and the river did not return to bankfull until 7p.m. EDT on the 18th. It was the first river to reach flood stage in the county at 1 p.m. EDT. Also in Somerset County, the North Branch of the Raritan River near Raritan crested at a RECORD BREAKING 18.8 feet at 11 p.m. EDT on the 16th.  Flood stage is 10 feet.  Farther downstream the Raritan River in Manville crested at a RECORD BREAKING 27.5 feet at midnight on the 17th.  Flood stage is nearly half as low, 14 feet.  In Bound Brook the Raritan River crested at a RECORD BREAKING 42.1 feet at 1030 p.m. EDT on the 16th. Flood stage is 28 feet.  The previous record set during Tropical Storm Doria was 37.5 feet set on August 28, 1971.  Flooding started at all of the three Raritan River points around 5 p.m. EDT.  Upstream in Hunterdon County, the South Branch of the Raritan River in High Bridge crested at 10.9 feet at Midnight EDT on the 17th.  Flood stage is 10 feet.  Farther downstream in Stanton, the South Branch of the Raritan River had its second highest crest on record, 13.9 feet at 8 p.m. EDT on the 16th. Flood stage is 8 feet.  In the Passaic River Basin in Morris County, the Rockaway River above the Boonton Reservoir crested at 6.3 feet at 1215 a.m. EDT on the 17th.  Flood stage is 5 feet. The Pompton River in Pompton Plains crested at its third highest ever at 21.0 feet at 3 a.m. EDT on the 17th. Flood stage is 16 feet.  Along the main stem of the Passaic River, along the Somerset County/Morris County border, in Millington the Passaic crested at 8.8 feet at 3 a.m. EDT on the 17th. The estimated flood stage is 8 feet. In Chatham (Morris County), the Passaic River crested at 7.6 feet at 530 p.m. EDT on the 17th.  Flood stage is 6 feet.  In Pine Brook (Morris County), the Passaic River crested at 20.8 feet at 9 a.m. EDT on the 18th.  Flood stage is estimated at 19 feet.  This point remained above its estimated flood stage the longest in the Passaic Basin, the river did not return to bankfull until 7 a.m. EDT on the 23rd.  In Mercer County, the Assunpink Creek in Trenton reached its 7 foot flood stage at 9 a.m. EDT on the 17th, the first gaged stream to hit flood stage that day.  It crested at 13.9 feet at 1 a.m. EDT on the 17th, the second highest crest on record. In Burlington County, the North Branch of the Rancocas Creek in Pemberton crested at 3.2 feet at 9 p.m. EDT on the 17th.  Flood stage is 2.7 feet.  In Camden County, the Cooper River at Haddonfield crested at 3.9 feet at 5 p.m. EDT on the 16th. Flood stage is 2.8 feet.  Highest reported wind gusts were 62 mph in Browns Mills (Burlington County), 58 mph at the Commodore Barry Bridge (Gloucester County), 52 mph in Luke's Bay (Atlantic County), Waretown (Ocean County) and Sandy Hook (Monmouth County), 47 mph in High Point (Sussex County), 44 mph in Trenton (Mercer County) and 40 mph in MIllville (Cumberland County).

The hurricane will go down in history as the greatest natural disaster to ever effect the state of New Jersey to date.  Preliminary damage estimates for the entire state were 1.1 billion dollars hitting Bergen and Somerset Counties the hardest. Manville and Bound Brook were hardest hit within Somerset County.  Six persons died in the state; all drownings: two each in Somerset and Bergen Counties, one in Passaic County and one in Salem County.  Hundreds were injured.  The hurricane caused record breaking flooding in the Raritan River Basin as storm totals averaged around ten inches. In spite of similar storm total amounts, the flooding in the Passaic River Basin did not exceed the record set in April of 1984, but reached as high as the third highest crest on record for some streams.  Excluding the northeast part of the state, storm totals elsewhere in the state ranged from three to ten inches with the highest amounts in Mercer County.  There were hundreds of rescues from creeks and trapped/submerged vehicles.  Many people ignored barricades and became stranded in flood waters. About 26,000 persons in the state were evacuated, about half of them in Somerset and Bergen Counties. Statewide 78 homes, 105 apartments (all in Somerset County) and 75 businesses were destroyed.  Statewide 3,900 homes, 1,208 apartments and 1,683 businesses suffered major damage defined as losing up to 50 percent of the property's value.  Statewide 23,235 homes, 1,758 apartments and 1,043 businesses suffered minor damage defined as suffering more than $10,000 in damage.  Statewide 39,113 homes, 2,232 apartments and 2,183 businesses suffered some damage defined as losing greater than $200 in damage. About 616,400 homes and businesses lost power throughout the state for up to five days.  About 17,800 homes and businesses, mainly around Somerset County, did not have gas service for up to two weeks.   About 500,000 persons in the Raritan Valley had to boil their water for eight days and not bathe as the flooding crippled the Elizabethtown Water Company's main water treatment plant in Bridgewater (Somerset County).  With the plant off line, water pressure was also low. Some municipalities received little, if any, water.  Other sewage treatment plants were so overwhelmed with runoff that many spewed raw sewage into the streams and rivers.  Schools were closed on the 16th as Governor Christie Whitman declared a state of emergency.  Service along Amtrak's Northeast Corridor was disrupted and not resumed until Saturday the 18th.  Service on several New Jersey Transit Lines was not resumed until the work week of the 20th.

A 40-year-old man drowned in the Salem River near Pennsville Township in Salem County.  An 85-year-old woman and her 58-year-old son drowned in Bound Brook (Somerset County) after they refused to evacuate and became trapped in their first floor apartment. The highest verifiable storm total was 14.45 inches in Pompton Lakes (Passaic County).  Nearby Philadelphia International Airport not only set a new daily precipitation record of  6.63 inches, but also a new 24 hour record of 6.77 inches. Based on SKYWARN Spotter reports and Doppler Radar precipitation estimates, the area of heaviest rain coincided with the first significant rise in elevation in the northern half of the state around the Watchung Mountains. Doppler storm total estimates of 10 to 12 inches covered much of the eastern half of Hunterdon County, the western half of Somerset County, extreme eastern parts of Morris County and adjacent areas in Essex, Passaic and Union Counties. Lesser amounts fell in the rest of northwest New Jersey.  Farther to the south, storm totals increased farther west in New Jersey with locations along the Delaware River receiving the heaviest amounts.  Doppler Radar storm total estimates reached 10 inches in Salem and Mercer Counties. The torrential downpours associated with Hurricane Floyd exceeded the 100-year-flood return period in the Raritan Basin as several rivers and streams either set record or had their second highest crest on record.  The combination of winds funneling into the Delaware Bay and the Delaware River and the record runoff from inland waterways produced minor to moderate tidal flooding at the times of high tide in Cumberland, Salem, Gloucester, Camden and Burlington Counties.  Evacuations occurred in low-lying areas near the river.  The evening (16th) high tide also slowed the discharge of streams into the Delaware.  The highest wind gusts were mainly less than 60 mph.  But, the combination of the heavy rain that loosened the ground and the persistence of the strong winds uprooted hundreds of trees.  President Clinton declared Bergen, Essex, Mercer, Middlesex, Morris, Passaic, Somerset and Union Counties a disaster area.  Homeowners in Hunterdon County were also eligible for damage assistance. 

Hurricane Floyd began as a Cape Verde type hurricane east of the Lesser Antilles.  As Floyd moved west, it passed to the north of and spared both the Greater and Lesser Antilles.  Floyd intensified into a Category IV (Major) Hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Scale.  Floyd was a large sized hurricane that  prolonged both the torrential rain and high winds.  Floyd was heading for Florida before a turn to the northwest spared the state, but Floyd battered the Bahamas.  The anticipated turn to the north and the northeast occurred on the 15th as Floyd was heading for North Carolina.  Another important synoptic feature was a cold front that was over West Virginia on the 14th.  This front stalled in Eastern Pennsylvania on the 15th.  The stalled front not only failed to push offshore an already tropical and humid air mass that was over the state, but also acted as a conduit for the tropical moisture associated with Floyd.  The moisture headed west toward the front, rising upward and dropped the heaviest rain in upslope areas of the state.  Light rain associated with Floyd started in the state on the 15th.  The torrential rain associated with Floyd arrived around 3 a.m. EDT in the southern part of the state and spread into Sussex County  by 10 a.m. EDT.  Floyd was just making landfall at the Mouth of Cape Fear or Bald Head Island in North Carolina as the heavy rain reached Mount Holly. Floyd started to accelerate northeast during the morning of the 16th.  Some gusty winds arrived in the state during the morning of the 16th.  A weakened (with respect to wind) Category One Floyd moved through Virginia Beach, Virginia and was back over the open Atlantic Ocean around noon on the 16th.  Floyd continued to move northeast and the eye passed just east of the Virginia Capes and Fenwick Island, Delaware around 3 p.m. EDT.  By the afternoon of the 16th all the torrential rain had moved north of Floyd and ended with the passage of the hurricane (on the same latitude line).  During the afternoon of the 16th all of the sustained hurricane force winds were located over the Atlantic. At 5 p.m. EDT Floyd was downgraded to a tropical storm as it passed about 10 miles east of Atlantic City.  Between 5 p.m. and 9 p.m. EDT the torrential rain ended across the state from south to north.  The strongest winds associated with Floyd mixed down as cooler air behind the system moved into the region.   For many locations the strongest wind gusts occurred between 4 p.m. and 10 p.m. EDT and the highest gusts occurred over higher terrain locations. Wind gusts rarely exceeded 50 mph, but all the flooding rains made it easier for trees to be knocked over.  Tropical Storm Floyd made landfall again on western Fire Island in Suffolk County,  New York around 8 p.m. EDT and was located near Portland, Maine at 8 a.m. EDT on the 17th. 
 
Somerset County and Bound Brook and Manville specifically were hit the hardest (in the Mount Holly, NJ area of forecast and warning responsibility).  Expressions such as "It's gone.", "It's totaled.", "It's like nothing we've seen before." were used to describe the flooding in downtown Bound Brook.  About 2,000 persons were evacuated, 800 were rescued from second story windows and rooftops in the downtown and west end areas. The downtown was covered by an estimated thirteen feet of water. Flooding stretched from Tea Street to Billian-Legion Park and reached as high as High Street.  Due to an electrical malfunction, a fire broke out in a cluster of stores on Main Street in Bound Brook.  Flood waters prevented firefighters from getting close.  Four stores were gutted, three others were heavily damaged. Borough schools were closed through the 24th.  Main Street was not reopened until October 5th. More than 200 homes were condemned.  Manville was hit equally as hard as 1,000 persons were evacuated from 360 homes in the Lost Valley section.  In all 1,500 homes were damaged and 284 homes were condemned.  The mud line was 10 feet above ground level. Both boroughs are along the Raritan River and the Raritan set new record crests at both locations breaking the previous record set during Tropical Storm Doria on August 28, 1971. Flood waters from the Raritan River also inundated the Elizabethtown Water Company's main water treatment plant in Bridgewater.  About 500,000 customers in Hunterdon, Mercer, Middlesex and Somerset Counties were forced to boil their water and advised not to bathe.  The plant tripping off line also produced low water pressure that affected numerous municipalities. The National Guard delivered more than 500,000 bottles of water. The plant started to pump some water on Monday the 20th, was back to one-third of capacity on the 23rd and cancelled the boiling advisory at 8 p.m. EDT on the 24th.  Many schools and businesses could not open until an adequate and safe water supply returned.  Flooding along the Green Brook pushed up to three feet of sewage contaminated flood waters into the first floor of Green Brook Township's Municipal Building.  In Hillsborough Township 600 homes were damaged and 200 persons were evacuated along the Millstone and Neshanic Rivers. A rescue boat capsized while trying to rescue a man trapped in a tree for two hours.  In Franklin Township, flood waters from the Raritan River reached 10 feet inside the buildings of the Zarapeth Community Church destroying 20,000 volumes of books in its Bible Institute. Damage here alone was estimated at 2.5 million dollars.  Nearly every township had flooded roads and low-lying area evacuations.  Many townships were effectively cut-off. Downed trees exacerbated the damage mainly in the northern part of the county. Seventy-five percent of all the bridges in the county were damaged.  Eight bridges remained closed in Bedminster, Bound Brook, Hillsborough and Montgomery.  Several of them were damaged from logs smashing into them.  Four bridges remained closed on October 19th.  Numerous waterways were contaminated with raw sewage, heating oil and other pollutants.  A 58-year-old building inspector became ill with Legionnaire's Disease during the clean-up.  About 4,400 persons were evacuated throughout the county, 60 persons were still in shelters on October 15th.  Many businesses in downtown Bound Brook and Manville were not expected to reopen.   

Farther downstream in Middlesex County the Raritan River flooding also took its toll.  As the Raritan River was rising, the incoming high tide during the early morning of the 17th prevented it from discharging into the bay.  Around the time of this high tide, the Raritan River caused the worst flooding in memory in Middlesex County.  About 3,300 persons were sheltered as evacuations occurred in New Brunswick, Carteret, Dunellen, Edison, South Brunswick, South Plainfield and Woodbridge. In New Brunswick the Raritan river flooded over New Jersey State Route 18. Flood waters cascaded around the New Brunswick Homes and River Watch Apartment Complexes (about 1,000 persons were evacuated), the New Brunswick Police Department and the New Brunswick Municipal Court.  Neither of the municipal buildings were used again. New Jersey State Route 18 opened the afternoon of the 18th.  Three bridges were closed. The Delaware and Raritan Canal Locks, swing bridge and tow path were damaged.  Severe flooding damage was reported in Highland Park, Middlesex Borough, Piscataway,  South Plainfield and Woodbridge.  In Middlesex Borough  500 homes were damaged and the damage estimate was 6 million dollars.  In Woodbridge, flooded stores were not expected to be reopened for weeks.  In Piscataway where damage estimates reached 5 million dollars, the Riverside, Mayflower and Birchview Apartment Complexes were severely flooded. Parks near the Raritan River were also badly damaged. In Edison, low water pressure problems associated with the Elizabethtown Water Treatment Plant resulted in little or no water for the township through the 20th.  The National Guard was providing water.  Numerous streams flooded throughout the county.  By early afternoon 30 to 40 roads throughout the county were already closed with numerous water rescues from car tops taking place.  Rutgers University canceled classes on both the 16th and 17th.  Downed trees were reported in Metuchen and over 100 homes were damaged by flooding in Dunellen.  Another affect of Floyd was the thousands of barrels and drums (some containing hazardous solvents and acids) were found bobbing in the waters of Raritan and Sandy Hook Bays and washed ashore on local beaches.        

Upstream areas in the Raritan Basin did not fare much better.  In Hunterdon County five homes were destroyed, 117 had major damage and 582 had minor damage.  Two apartments suffered major damage and 7 suffered minor damage. Twenty-four businesses also were damaged.  About 125 persons were evacuated. Five percent of all county roads were damaged and three bridges (In East Amwell, Franklin and Readington Townships) were expected to remain closed through mid November.   Hardest hit was Lambertville, especially the south side of the city near Swan Creek.  Nearly 100 homes were flooded and half the evacuations within the county occurred in this city.  The flooding creek also cracked a water pipe leaving the south side of the city with no water.  Elsewhere the elementary school was flooded with nearly two feet of water (damage estimate 1.1 million) as a creek behind the school overflowed.  The school did not reopen until Tuesday September 28th.  Other streams and rivers flooded in Alexandria, Califon, Frenchtown and Holland Townships.  High winds also damaged two homes in Holland Township and vehicles in Frenchtown Borough.

Elsewhere in Northwest New Jersey, Morris County in the Passaic Basin was hit hard.  It was one of the hardest hit counties with respect to wind damage in the state.  Hundreds of trees were knocked down.  About 1,500 persons were evacuated because of flooding.  Numerous roads were closed including NJ State Routes 10 and 23, U.S. Route 46 and NJ State Route 53.  The hardest hit municipalities were Pequannock and Lincoln Park along the Pompton River.  Flooding caused an estimated 5.5 million dollars to two hundred fifty homes in Pequannock.  One home collapsed and trapped two persons and a dog inside.  They were rescued.  Thirty-five roads alone in Pequannock were closed. Flooding along the Rockaway River caused evacuations in Denville and Dover. Three hundred homes were flooded in Dover.  Flooding along the Whippany River forced the evacuation of 50 families in Morristown and closed 15 roads in Mendham Township. Serious flooding also occurred along the South Branch of the Raritan River in Washington Township, the Loantanka Brook in Harding Township and Terrace Lake in Butler Borough.  Flooding caused the Allen Street Bridge to collapse in Netcong Borough. Numerous trees were knocked down in Boonton, Harding, Mendham, Netcong and Washington Townships.  Dozens of homes were damaged by the fallen trees.  In Mendham Township, 100 foot tall oak trees were snapped.  In Harding Township, 90 percent of the township lost power because of downed trees.  Every house on one block of Millbrook Road had downed trees on it.  School were closed through Friday the 17th throughout most of the county and New Jersey Transit Rail Service was not returned to full operations until Monday the 20th.

On a relative basis the effects of Floyd diminished across Warren and Sussex Counties.  In Franklin Township in Warren County a trailer exploded after flood waters caused a short in the wiring of a propane stove and spread to the tanks outside.  The trailer exploded, but no one was hurt since the trailer park was already evacuated because of flooding.   About 38,000 homes and businesses lost power.  Power was not fully restored until the 21st. Hardest hit were Byram Township, Frankford Township, Hopatcong Borough and the town of Newton.  Flooding caused by Floyd contaminated municipal wells in Andover and Hampton Townships. 

In Central New Jersey, Mercer County was hit the hardest and was also included in the disaster declaration. About 400 persons were evacuated in Ewing and Lawrence Townships and in Trenton.  About 85 major roads were closed including sections of Interstate 95, U.S. Routes 1 and 130 and New Jersey State Route 33. Hundreds of water rescues from trapped vehicles occurred. In Trenton the worst flood damage occurred along the Assunpink Creek.  Forty homes and three businesses were damaged on Mulberry Street, Dickinson Street and North Clinton Avenue. In Ewing Township, about 150 residents were evacuated from the Willow Creek Rehabilitation and Care Center.  In Lawrence Township, six homes were badly damaged (condemned) by flood waters from the Delaware and Raritan Canal.  Businesses, car dealerships and residents near the Shabakunk Creek also suffered flood damage.  U.S. Route 1 buckled. In Princeton, schools were closed until Monday the 20th because of the combination of flood damage and water quality problems stemming from the Elizabethtown Water Company's Bridgewater treatment plant.  High winds took their toll also.  The chimney blew down onto the roof of the Imani Community Church. Pieces of the chimney crashed through the roof.  The replacement cost was estimated at 1 million dollars.

In Monmouth County, the worst flooding related problems occurred around noon EDT as the torrential rain coincided with the high tide. The worst flooding was reported in Union Beach and bay areas of Middletown Township. Mandatory evacuations occurred in Union Beach (which became an island) and voluntary evacuations occurred in Middletown Township along the bay and near Compton's and Pew Creeks. New Jersey State Routes 35 and 36 were closed due to flooding.  Farther inland, Manalapan Township was hardest hit with overflowing brooks that forced the closure of six roads and sandbagging of homes on Birmingham Road.  The strongest winds occurred during the evening and blew down transformers, wires, tree limbs and several trees throughout the county. Coastal areas escaped with minimal damage: just some minor beach erosion and minor back bay flooding at times of high tide. Thousands of barrels and drums (some containing hazardous solvents and acids) were found bobbing in the waters of Raritan and Sandy Hook Bays and washed ashore on local beaches.  
 
Across the southern half of New Jersey, the heaviest rain and the most widespread flooding occurred in townships along the Delaware River.  Less rain and flooding occurred farther southeast with less urban and poor drainage flooding and only minor beach erosion and back bay flooding reported in Atlantic, Cape May and Ocean Counties. The worst flooding occurred along some of the larger waterways in the area (Cooper River in Camden County, Rancocas Creek in Burlington County) and along tidal sections of tributaries to the Delaware River. This peaked during the evening high tide as winds funneled into the bay and brought higher tidal departures and slowed the discharge of inland waterways. The high tide in Philadelphia reached 9.4 feet above mean lower low water at around 640 p.m. EDT.  Moderate tidal flooding starts at 9.2 feet above mean lower low water. In Burlington County, some evacuations occurred in Riverside around the Delanco-Riverside Bridge.  The bridge was also closed.  Farther upstream along the Rancocas Creek the Centerton Bridge in Willingboro was closed.  Voluntary evacuations also occurred along the Delaware River in Delran and roads near the Rancocas Creek were closed.  Several evacuations also occurred along the Assicunk Creek in Burlington City.  Creek flooding (mainly the Rancocas) occurred in Medford, Mount Holly and Westampton Townships.  About 10 roads in the county were closed due to flooding.  In Camden County the worst flooding occurred in Collingswood along U.S. Route 130 between the Airport Circle and Collings Avenue.  Some homes were flooded and evacuated as raw sewage was present.  Flooding from Floyd knocked out a state psychiatric hospital's wastewater treatment plant in Winslow Township.  Downed trees damaged a home in Blackwood Township. In Gloucester County, about 40 persons were evacuated in Gibbstown after the Gibbstown Levee partially gave way and sent water from the Delaware River and Repaupo Creek into Gibbstown.  In adjacent Logan Township, about 20 persons were evacuated near Floodgate Road.  There were also additional voluntary evacuations in low-lying areas of both Logan and Monroe Townships. Sections of U.S. Route 130 were closed. One road collapsed in Woolwich Township and the torrential rain contributed to a fatal accident on the New Jersey Turnpike. In Salem County, tidal flooding occurred in Penns Grove.  A 40-year-old man died when he fell into the Salem near Pennsville.  Several dam failures occurred. In Cumberland County, 3,700 persons living in mobile home parks in Vineland were evacuated.  Farmers also feared that the heavy rain would ruin the fall spinach crop.  In Ocean County, elderly residents of Laurelton Gardens in Brick Township were evacuated after a creek flooded.  Scattered trees and wires were knocked down throughout the county.  A tree damaged a house in Toms River.

In Somerset County the Millstone River at Blackwells Mills crested at a RECORD BREAKING 21.0 feet at 345 a.m. EDT on the 17th. Flood stage is 9 feet and the river did not return to bankfull until 7p.m. EDT on the 18th. It was the first river to reach flood stage in the county at 1 p.m. EDT. Also in Somerset County, the North Branch of the Raritan River near Raritan crested at a RECORD BREAKING 18.8 feet at 11 p.m. EDT on the 16th.  Flood stage is 10 feet.  Farther downstream the Raritan River in Manville crested at a RECORD BREAKING 27.5 feet at midnight on the 17th.  Flood stage is nearly half as low, 14 feet.  In Bound Brook the Raritan River crested at a RECORD BREAKING 42.1 feet at 1030 p.m. EDT on the 16th. Flood stage is 28 feet.  The previous record set during Tropical Storm Doria was 37.5 feet set on August 28, 1971.  Flooding started at all of the three Raritan River points around 5 p.m. EDT.  Upstream in Hunterdon County, the South Branch of the Raritan River in High Bridge crested at 10.9 feet at Midnight EDT on the 17th.  Flood stage is 10 feet.  Farther downstream in Stanton, the South Branch of the Raritan River had its second highest crest on record, 13.9 feet at 8 p.m. EDT on the 16th. Flood stage is 8 feet.  In the Passaic River Basin in Morris County, the Rockaway River above the Boonton Reservoir crested at 6.3 feet at 1215 a.m. EDT on the 17th.  Flood stage is 5 feet. The Pompton River in Pompton Plains crested at its third highest ever at 21.0 feet at 3 a.m. EDT on the 17th. Flood stage is 16 feet.  Along the main stem of the Passaic River, along the Somerset County/Morris County border, in Millington the Passaic crested at 8.8 feet at 3 a.m. EDT on the 17th. The estimated flood stage is 8 feet. In Chatham (Morris County), the Passaic River crested at 7.6 feet at 530 p.m. EDT on the 17th.  Flood stage is 6 feet.  In Pine Brook (Morris County), the Passaic River crested at 20.8 feet at 9 a.m. EDT on the 18th.  Flood stage is estimated at 19 feet.  This point remained above its estimated flood stage the longest in the Passaic Basin, the river did not return to bankfull until 7 a.m. EDT on the 23rd.  In Mercer County, the Assunpink Creek in Trenton reached its 7 foot flood stage at 9 a.m. EDT on the 17th, the first gaged stream to hit flood stage that day.  It crested at 13.9 feet at 1 a.m. EDT on the 17th, the second highest crest on record. In Burlington County, the North Branch of the Rancocas Creek in Pemberton crested at 3.2 feet at 9 p.m. EDT on the 17th.  Flood stage is 2.7 feet.  In Camden County, the Cooper River at Haddonfield crested at 3.9 feet at 5 p.m. EDT on the 16th. Flood stage is 2.8 feet.  Highest reported wind gusts were 62 mph in Browns Mills (Burlington County), 58 mph at the Commodore Barry Bridge (Gloucester County), 52 mph in Luke's Bay (Atlantic County), Waretown (Ocean County) and Sandy Hook (Monmouth County), 47 mph in High Point (Sussex County), 44 mph in Trenton (Mercer County) and 40 mph in MIllville (Cumberland County).

The hurricane will go down in history as the greatest natural disaster to ever effect the state of New Jersey to date.  Preliminary damage estimates for the entire state were 1.1 billion dollars hitting Bergen and Somerset Counties the hardest. Manville and Bound Brook were hardest hit within Somerset County.  Six persons died in the state; all drownings: two each in Somerset and Bergen Counties, one in Passaic County and one in Salem County.  Hundreds were injured.  The hurricane caused record breaking flooding in the Raritan River Basin as storm totals averaged around ten inches. In spite of similar storm total amounts, the flooding in the Passaic River Basin did not exceed the record set in April of 1984, but reached as high as the third highest crest on record for some streams.  Excluding the northeast part of the state, storm totals elsewhere in the state ranged from three to ten inches with the highest amounts in Mercer County.  There were hundreds of rescues from creeks and trapped/submerged vehicles.  Many people ignored barricades and became stranded in flood waters. About 26,000 persons in the state were evacuated, about half of them in Somerset and Bergen Counties. Statewide 78 homes, 105 apartments (all in Somerset County) and 75 businesses were destroyed.  Statewide 3,900 homes, 1,208 apartments and 1,683 businesses suffered major damage defined as losing up to 50 percent of the property's value.  Statewide 23,235 homes, 1,758 apartments and 1,043 businesses suffered minor damage defined as suffering more than $10,000 in damage.  Statewide 39,113 homes, 2,232 apartments and 2,183 businesses suffered some damage defined as losing greater than $200 in damage. About 616,400 homes and businesses lost power throughout the state for up to five days.  About 17,800 homes and businesses, mainly around Somerset County, did not have gas service for up to two weeks.   About 500,000 persons in the Raritan Valley had to boil their water for eight days and not bathe as the flooding crippled the Elizabethtown Water Company's main water treatment plant in Bridgewater (Somerset County).  With the plant off line, water pressure was also low. Some municipalities received little, if any, water.  Other sewage treatment plants were so overwhelmed with runoff that many spewed raw sewage into the streams and rivers.  Schools were closed on the 16th as Governor Christie Whitman declared a state of emergency.  Service along Amtrak's Northeast Corridor was disrupted and not resumed until Saturday the 18th.  Service on several New Jersey Transit Lines was not resumed until the work week of the 20th.

A 40-year-old man drowned in the Salem River near Pennsville Township in Salem County.  An 85-year-old woman and her 58-year-old son drowned in Bound Brook (Somerset County) after they refused to evacuate and became trapped in their first floor apartment. The highest verifiable storm total was 14.45 inches in Pompton Lakes (Passaic County).  Nearby Philadelphia International Airport not only set a new daily precipitation record of  6.63 inches, but also a new 24 hour record of 6.77 inches. Based on SKYWARN Spotter reports and Doppler Radar precipitation estimates, the area of heaviest rain coincided with the first significant rise in elevation in the northern half of the state around the Watchung Mountains. Doppler storm total estimates of 10 to 12 inches covered much of the eastern half of Hunterdon County, the western half of Somerset County, extreme eastern parts of Morris County and adjacent areas in Essex, Passaic and Union Counties. Lesser amounts fell in the rest of northwest New Jersey.  Farther to the south, storm totals increased farther west in New Jersey with locations along the Delaware River receiving the heaviest amounts.  Doppler Radar storm total estimates reached 10 inches in Salem and Mercer Counties. The torrential downpours associated with Hurricane Floyd exceeded the 100-year-flood return period in the Raritan Basin as several rivers and streams either set record or had their second highest crest on record.  The combination of winds funneling into the Delaware Bay and the Delaware River and the record runoff from inland waterways produced minor to moderate tidal flooding at the times of high tide in Cumberland, Salem, Gloucester, Camden and Burlington Counties.  Evacuations occurred in low-lying areas near the river.  The evening (16th) high tide also slowed the discharge of streams into the Delaware.  The highest wind gusts were mainly less than 60 mph.  But, the combination of the heavy rain that loosened the ground and the persistence of the strong winds uprooted hundreds of trees.  President Clinton declared Bergen, Essex, Mercer, Middlesex, Morris, Passaic, Somerset and Union Counties a disaster area.  Homeowners in Hunterdon County were also eligible for damage assistance. 

Hurricane Floyd began as a Cape Verde type hurricane east of the Lesser Antilles.  As Floyd moved west, it passed to the north of and spared both the Greater and Lesser Antilles.  Floyd intensified into a Category IV (Major) Hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Scale.  Floyd was a large sized hurricane that  prolonged both the torrential rain and high winds.  Floyd was heading for Florida before a turn to the northwest spared the state, but Floyd battered the Bahamas.  The anticipated turn to the north and the northeast occurred on the 15th as Floyd was heading for North Carolina.  Another important synoptic feature was a cold front that was over West Virginia on the 14th.  This front stalled in Eastern Pennsylvania on the 15th.  The stalled front not only failed to push offshore an already tropical and humid air mass that was over the state, but also acted as a conduit for the tropical moisture associated with Floyd.  The moisture headed west toward the front, rising upward and dropped the heaviest rain in upslope areas of the state.  Light rain associated with Floyd started in the state on the 15th.  The torrential rain associated with Floyd arrived around 3 a.m. EDT in the southern part of the state and spread into Sussex County  by 10 a.m. EDT.  Floyd was just making landfall at the Mouth of Cape Fear or Bald Head Island in North Carolina as the heavy rain reached Mount Holly. Floyd started to accelerate northeast during the morning of the 16th.  Some gusty winds arrived in the state during the morning of the 16th.  A weakened (with respect to wind) Category One Floyd moved through Virginia Beach, Virginia and was back over the open Atlantic Ocean around noon on the 16th.  Floyd continued to move northeast and the eye passed just east of the Virginia Capes and Fenwick Island, Delaware around 3 p.m. EDT.  By the afternoon of the 16th all the torrential rain had moved north of Floyd and ended with the passage of the hurricane (on the same latitude line).  During the afternoon of the 16th all of the sustained hurricane force winds were located over the Atlantic. At 5 p.m. EDT Floyd was downgraded to a tropical storm as it passed about 10 miles east of Atlantic City.  Between 5 p.m. and 9 p.m. EDT the torrential rain ended across the state from south to north.  The strongest winds associated with Floyd mixed down as cooler air behind the system moved into the region.   For many locations the strongest wind gusts occurred between 4 p.m. and 10 p.m. EDT and the highest gusts occurred over higher terrain locations. Wind gusts rarely exceeded 50 mph, but all the flooding rains made it easier for trees to be knocked over.  Tropical Storm Floyd made landfall again on western Fire Island in Suffolk County,  New York around 8 p.m. EDT and was located near Portland, Maine at 8 a.m. EDT on the 17th. 
 
Somerset County and Bound Brook and Manville specifically were hit the hardest (in the Mount Holly, NJ area of forecast and warning responsibility).  Expressions such as "It's gone.", "It's totaled.", "It's like nothing we've seen before." were used to describe the flooding in downtown Bound Brook.  About 2,000 persons were evacuated, 800 were rescued from second story windows and rooftops in the downtown and west end areas. The downtown was covered by an estimated thirteen feet of water. Flooding stretched from Tea Street to Billian-Legion Park and reached as high as High Street.  Due to an electrical malfunction, a fire broke out in a cluster of stores on Main Street in Bound Brook.  Flood waters prevented firefighters from getting close.  Four stores were gutted, three others were heavily damaged. Borough schools were closed through the 24th.  Main Street was not reopened until October 5th. More than 200 homes were condemned.  Manville was hit equally as hard as 1,000 persons were evacuated from 360 homes in the Lost Valley section.  In all 1,500 homes were damaged and 284 homes were condemned.  The mud line was 10 feet above ground level. Both boroughs are along the Raritan River and the Raritan set new record crests at both locations breaking the previous record set during Tropical Storm Doria on August 28, 1971. Flood waters from the Raritan River also inundated the Elizabethtown Water Company's main water treatment plant in Bridgewater.  About 500,000 customers in Hunterdon, Mercer, Middlesex and Somerset Counties were forced to boil their water and advised not to bathe.  The plant tripping off line also produced low water pressure that affected numerous municipalities. The National Guard delivered more than 500,000 bottles of water. The plant started to pump some water on Monday the 20th, was back to one-third of capacity on the 23rd and cancelled the boiling advisory at 8 p.m. EDT on the 24th.  Many schools and businesses could not open until an adequate and safe water supply returned.  Flooding along the Green Brook pushed up to three feet of sewage contaminated flood waters into the first floor of Green Brook Township's Municipal Building.  In Hillsborough Township 600 homes were damaged and 200 persons were evacuated along the Millstone and Neshanic Rivers. A rescue boat capsized while trying to rescue a man trapped in a tree for two hours.  In Franklin Township, flood waters from the Raritan River reached 10 feet inside the buildings of the Zarapeth Community Church destroying 20,000 volumes of books in its Bible Institute. Damage here alone was estimated at 2.5 million dollars.  Nearly every township had flooded roads and low-lying area evacuations.  Many townships were effectively cut-off. Downed trees exacerbated the damage mainly in the northern part of the county. Seventy-five percent of all the bridges in the county were damaged.  Eight bridges remained closed in Bedminster, Bound Brook, Hillsborough and Montgomery.  Several of them were damaged from logs smashing into them.  Four bridges remained closed on October 19th.  Numerous waterways were contaminated with raw sewage, heating oil and other pollutants.  A 58-year-old building inspector became ill with Legionnaire's Disease during the clean-up.  About 4,400 persons were evacuated throughout the county, 60 persons were still in shelters on October 15th.  Many businesses in downtown Bound Brook and Manville were not expected to reopen.   

Farther downstream in Middlesex County the Raritan River flooding also took its toll.  As the Raritan River was rising, the incoming high tide during the early morning of the 17th prevented it from discharging into the bay.  Around the time of this high tide, the Raritan River caused the worst flooding in memory in Middlesex County.  About 3,300 persons were sheltered as evacuations occurred in New Brunswick, Carteret, Dunellen, Edison, South Brunswick, South Plainfield and Woodbridge. In New Brunswick the Raritan river flooded over New Jersey State Route 18. Flood waters cascaded around the New Brunswick Homes and River Watch Apartment Complexes (about 1,000 persons were evacuated), the New Brunswick Police Department and the New Brunswick Municipal Court.  Neither of the municipal buildings were used again. New Jersey State Route 18 opened the afternoon of the 18th.  Three bridges were closed. The Delaware and Raritan Canal Locks, swing bridge and tow path were damaged.  Severe flooding damage was reported in Highland Park, Middlesex Borough, Piscataway,  South Plainfield and Woodbridge.  In Middlesex Borough  500 homes were damaged and the damage estimate was 6 million dollars.  In Woodbridge, flooded stores were not expected to be reopened for weeks.  In Piscataway where damage estimates reached 5 million dollars, the Riverside, Mayflower and Birchview Apartment Complexes were severely flooded. Parks near the Raritan River were also badly damaged. In Edison, low water pressure problems associated with the Elizabethtown Water Treatment Plant resulted in little or no water for the township through the 20th.  The National Guard was providing water.  Numerous streams flooded throughout the county.  By early afternoon 30 to 40 roads throughout the county were already closed with numerous water rescues from car tops taking place.  Rutgers University canceled classes on both the 16th and 17th.  Downed trees were reported in Metuchen and over 100 homes were damaged by flooding in Dunellen.  Another affect of Floyd was the thousands of barrels and drums (some containing hazardous solvents and acids) were found bobbing in the waters of Raritan and Sandy Hook Bays and washed ashore on local beaches.        

Upstream areas in the Raritan Basin did not fare much better.  In Hunterdon County five homes were destroyed, 117 had major damage and 582 had minor damage.  Two apartments suffered major damage and 7 suffered minor damage. Twenty-four businesses also were damaged.  About 125 persons were evacuated. Five percent of all county roads were damaged and three bridges (In East Amwell, Franklin and Readington Townships) were expected to remain closed through mid November.   Hardest hit was Lambertville, especially the south side of the city near Swan Creek.  Nearly 100 homes were flooded and half the evacuations within the county occurred in this city.  The flooding creek also cracked a water pipe leaving the south side of the city with no water.  Elsewhere the elementary school was flooded with nearly two feet of water (damage estimate 1.1 million) as a creek behind the school overflowed.  The school did not reopen until Tuesday September 28th.  Other streams and rivers flooded in Alexandria, Califon, Frenchtown and Holland Townships.  High winds also damaged two homes in Holland Township and vehicles in Frenchtown Borough.

Elsewhere in Northwest New Jersey, Morris County in the Passaic Basin was hit hard.  It was one of the hardest hit counties with respect to wind damage in the state.  Hundreds of trees were knocked down.  About 1,500 persons were evacuated because of flooding.  Numerous roads were closed including NJ State Routes 10 and 23, U.S. Route 46 and NJ State Route 53.  The hardest hit municipalities were Pequannock and Lincoln Park along the Pompton River.  Flooding caused an estimated 5.5 million dollars to two hundred fifty homes in Pequannock.  One home collapsed and trapped two persons and a dog inside.  They were rescued.  Thirty-five roads alone in Pequannock were closed. Flooding along the Rockaway River caused evacuations in Denville and Dover. Three hundred homes were flooded in Dover.  Flooding along the Whippany River forced the evacuation of 50 families in Morristown and closed 15 roads in Mendham Township. Serious flooding also occurred along the South Branch of the Raritan River in Washington Township, the Loantanka Brook in Harding Township and Terrace Lake in Butler Borough.  Flooding caused the Allen Street Bridge to collapse in Netcong Borough. Numerous trees were knocked down in Boonton, Harding, Mendham, Netcong and Washington Townships.  Dozens of homes were damaged by the fallen trees.  In Mendham Township, 100 foot tall oak trees were snapped.  In Harding Township, 90 percent of the township lost power because of downed trees.  Every house on one block of Millbrook Road had downed trees on it.  School were closed through Friday the 17th throughout most of the county and New Jersey Transit Rail Service was not returned to full operations until Monday the 20th.

On a relative basis the effects of Floyd diminished across Warren and Sussex Counties.  In Franklin Township in Warren County a trailer exploded after flood waters caused a short in the wiring of a propane stove and spread to the tanks outside.  The trailer exploded, but no one was hurt since the trailer park was already evacuated because of flooding.   About 38,000 homes and businesses lost power.  Power was not fully restored until the 21st. Hardest hit were Byram Township, Frankford Township, Hopatcong Borough and the town of Newton.  Flooding caused by Floyd contaminated municipal wells in Andover and Hampton Townships. 

In Central New Jersey, Mercer County was hit the hardest and was also included in the disaster declaration. About 400 persons were evacuated in Ewing and Lawrence Townships and in Trenton.  About 85 major roads were closed including sections of Interstate 95, U.S. Routes 1 and 130 and New Jersey State Route 33. Hundreds of water rescues from trapped vehicles occurred. In Trenton the worst flood damage occurred along the Assunpink Creek.  Forty homes and three businesses were damaged on Mulberry Street, Dickinson Street and North Clinton Avenue. In Ewing Township, about 150 residents were evacuated from the Willow Creek Rehabilitation and Care Center.  In Lawrence Township, six homes were badly damaged (condemned) by flood waters from the Delaware and Raritan Canal.  Businesses, car dealerships and residents near the Shabakunk Creek also suffered flood damage.  U.S. Route 1 buckled. In Princeton, schools were closed until Monday the 20th because of the combination of flood damage and water quality problems stemming from the Elizabethtown Water Company's Bridgewater treatment plant.  High winds took their toll also.  The chimney blew down onto the roof of the Imani Community Church. Pieces of the chimney crashed through the roof.  The replacement cost was estimated at 1 million dollars.

In Monmouth County, the worst flooding related problems occurred around noon EDT as the torrential rain coincided with the high tide. The worst flooding was reported in Union Beach and bay areas of Middletown Township. Mandatory evacuations occurred in Union Beach (which became an island) and voluntary evacuations occurred in Middletown Township along the bay and near Compton's and Pew Creeks. New Jersey State Routes 35 and 36 were closed due to flooding.  Farther inland, Manalapan Township was hardest hit with overflowing brooks that forced the closure of six roads and sandbagging of homes on Birmingham Road.  The strongest winds occurred during the evening and blew down transformers, wires, tree limbs and several trees throughout the county. Coastal areas escaped with minimal damage: just some minor beach erosion and minor back bay flooding at times of high tide. Thousands of barrels and drums (some containing hazardous solvents and acids) were found bobbing in the waters of Raritan and Sandy Hook Bays and washed ashore on local beaches.  
 
Across the southern half of New Jersey, the heaviest rain and the most widespread flooding occurred in townships along the Delaware River.  Less rain and flooding occurred farther southeast with less urban and poor drainage flooding and only minor beach erosion and back bay flooding reported in Atlantic, Cape May and Ocean Counties. The worst flooding occurred along some of the larger waterways in the area (Cooper River in Camden County, Rancocas Creek in Burlington County) and along tidal sections of tributaries to the Delaware River. This peaked during the evening high tide as winds funneled into the bay and brought higher tidal departures and slowed the discharge of inland waterways. The high tide in Philadelphia reached 9.4 feet above mean lower low water at around 640 p.m. EDT.  Moderate tidal flooding starts at 9.2 feet above mean lower low water. In Burlington County, some evacuations occurred in Riverside around the Delanco-Riverside Bridge.  The bridge was also closed.  Farther upstream along the Rancocas Creek the Centerton Bridge in Willingboro was closed.  Voluntary evacuations also occurred along the Delaware River in Delran and roads near the Rancocas Creek were closed.  Several evacuations also occurred along the Assicunk Creek in Burlington City.  Creek flooding (mainly the Rancocas) occurred in Medford, Mount Holly and Westampton Townships.  About 10 roads in the county were closed due to flooding.  In Camden County the worst flooding occurred in Collingswood along U.S. Route 130 between the Airport Circle and Collings Avenue.  Some homes were flooded and evacuated as raw sewage was present.  Flooding from Floyd knocked out a state psychiatric hospital's wastewater treatment plant in Winslow Township.  Downed trees damaged a home in Blackwood Township. In Gloucester County, about 40 persons were evacuated in Gibbstown after the Gibbstown Levee partially gave way and sent water from the Delaware River and Repaupo Creek into Gibbstown.  In adjacent Logan Township, about 20 persons were evacuated near Floodgate Road.  There were also additional voluntary evacuations in low-lying areas of both Logan and Monroe Townships. Sections of U.S. Route 130 were closed. One road collapsed in Woolwich Township and the torrential rain contributed to a fatal accident on the New Jersey Turnpike. In Salem County, tidal flooding occurred in Penns Grove.  A 40-year-old man died when he fell into the Salem near Pennsville.  Several dam failures occurred. In Cumberland County, 3,700 persons living in mobile home parks in Vineland were evacuated.  Farmers also feared that the heavy rain would ruin the fall spinach crop.  In Ocean County, elderly residents of Laurelton Gardens in Brick Township were evacuated after a creek flooded.  Scattered trees and wires were knocked down throughout the county.  A tree damaged a house in Toms River.

In Somerset County the Millstone River at Blackwells Mills crested at a RECORD BREAKING 21.0 feet at 345 a.m. EDT on the 17th.

In Mercer County, the Assunpink Creek in Trenton reached its 7 foot flood stage at 9 a.m. EDT on the 17th, the first gaged stream to hit flood stage that day.  It crested at 13.9 feet at 1 a.m. EDT on the 17th, the second highest crest on record. In Burlington County, the North Branch of the Rancocas Creek in Pemberton crested at 3.2 feet at 9 p.m. EDT on the 17th.  Flood stage is 2.7 feet.  In Camden County, the Cooper River at Haddonfield crested at 3.9 feet at 5 p.m. EDT on the 16th. Flood stage is 2.8 feet.

The hurricane will go down in history as the greatest natural disaster to ever effect the state of New Jersey to date.  Preliminary damage estimates for the entire state were 1.1 billion dollars hitting Bergen and Somerset Counties the hardest. Manville and Bound Brook were hardest hit within Somerset County.  Six persons died in the state; all drownings: two each in Somerset and Bergen Counties, one in Passaic County and one in Salem County.  Hundreds were injured.  The hurricane caused record breaking flooding in the Raritan River Basin as storm totals averaged around ten inches. In spite of similar storm total amounts, the flooding in the Passaic River Basin did not exceed the record set in April of 1984, but reached as high as the third highest crest on record for some streams.  Excluding the northeast part of the state, storm totals elsewhere in the state ranged from three to ten inches with the highest amounts in Mercer County.  There were hundreds of rescues from creeks and trapped/submerged vehicles.  Many people ignored barricades and became stranded in flood waters. About 26,000 persons in the state were evacuated, about half of them in Somerset and Bergen Counties. Statewide 78 homes, 105 apartments (all in Somerset County) and 75 businesses were destroyed.  Statewide 3,900 homes, 1,208 apartments and 1,683 businesses suffered major damage defined as losing up to 50 percent of the property's value.  Statewide 23,235 homes, 1,758 apartments and 1,043 businesses suffered minor damage defined as suffering more than $10,000 in damage.  Statewide 39,113 homes, 2,232 apartments and 2,183 businesses suffered some damage defined as losing greater than $200 in damage. About 616,400 homes and businesses lost power throughout the state for up to five days.  About 17,800 homes and businesses, mainly around Somerset County, did not have gas service for up to two weeks.   About 500,000 persons in the Raritan Valley had to boil their water for eight days and not bathe as the flooding crippled the Elizabethtown Water Company's main water treatment plant in Bridgewater (Somerset County).  With the plant off line, water pressure was also low. Some municipalities received little, if any, water.  Other sewage treatment plants were so overwhelmed with runoff that many spewed raw sewage into the streams and rivers.  Schools were closed on the 16th as Governor Christie Whitman declared a state of emergency.  Service along Amtrak's Northeast Corridor was disrupted and not resumed until Saturday the 18th.  Service on several New Jersey Transit Lines was not resumed until the work week of the 20th.

A 40-year-old man drowned in the Salem River near Pennsville Township in Salem County.  An 85-year-old woman and her 58-year-old son drowned in Bound Brook (Somerset County) after they refused to evacuate and became trapped in their first floor apartment. The highest verifiable storm total was 14.45 inches in Pompton Lakes (Passaic County).  Nearby Philadelphia International Airport not only set a new daily precipitation record of  6.63 inches, but also a new 24 hour record of 6.77 inches. Based on SKYWARN Spotter reports and Doppler Radar precipitation estimates, the area of heaviest rain coincided with the first significant rise in elevation in the northern half of the state around the Watchung Mountains. Doppler storm total estimates of 10 to 12 inches covered much of the eastern half of Hunterdon County, the western half of Somerset County, extreme eastern parts of Morris County and adjacent areas in Essex, Passaic and Union Counties. Lesser amounts fell in the rest of northwest New Jersey.  Farther to the south, storm totals increased farther west in New Jersey with locations along the Delaware River receiving the heaviest amounts.  Doppler Radar storm total estimates reached 10 inches in Salem and Mercer Counties. The torrential downpours associated with Hurricane Floyd exceeded the 100-year-flood return period in the Raritan Basin as several rivers and streams either set record or had their second highest crest on record.  The combination of winds funneling into the Delaware Bay and the Delaware River and the record runoff from inland waterways produced minor to moderate tidal flooding at the times of high tide in Cumberland, Salem, Gloucester, Camden and Burlington Counties.  Evacuations occurred in low-lying areas near the river.  The evening (16th) high tide also slowed the discharge of streams into the Delaware.  The highest wind gusts were mainly less than 60 mph.  But, the combination of the heavy rain that loosened the ground and the persistence of the strong winds uprooted hundreds of trees.  President Clinton declared Bergen, Essex, Mercer, Middlesex, Morris, Passaic, Somerset and Union Counties a disaster area.  Homeowners in Hunterdon County were also eligible for damage assistance. 

Hurricane Floyd began as a Cape Verde type hurricane east of the Lesser Antilles.  As Floyd moved west, it passed to the north of and spared both the Greater and Lesser Antilles.  Floyd intensified into a Category IV (Major) Hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Scale.  Floyd was a large sized hurricane that  prolonged both the torrential rain and high winds.  Floyd was heading for Florida before a turn to the northwest spared the state, but Floyd battered the Bahamas.  The anticipated turn to the north and the northeast occurred on the 15th as Floyd was heading for North Carolina.  Another important synoptic feature was a cold front that was over West Virginia on the 14th.  This front stalled in Eastern Pennsylvania on the 15th.  The stalled front not only failed to push offshore an already tropical and humid air mass that was over the state, but also acted as a conduit for the tropical moisture associated with Floyd.  The moisture headed west toward the front, rising upward and dropped the heaviest rain in upslope areas of the state.  Light rain associated with Floyd started in the state on the 15th.  The torrential rain associated with Floyd arrived around 3 a.m. EDT in the southern part of the state and spread into Sussex County  by 10 a.m. EDT.  Floyd was just making landfall at the Mouth of Cape Fear or Bald Head Island in North Carolina as the heavy rain reached Mount Holly. Floyd started to accelerate northeast during the morning of the 16th.  Some gusty winds arrived in the state during the morning of the 16th.  A weakened (with respect to wind) Category One Floyd moved through Virginia Beach, Virginia and was back over the open Atlantic Ocean around noon on the 16th.  Floyd continued to move northeast and the eye passed just east of the Virginia Capes and Fenwick Island, Delaware around 3 p.m. EDT.  By the afternoon of the 16th all the torrential rain had moved north of Floyd and ended with the passage of the hurricane (on the same latitude line).  During the afternoon of the 16th all of the sustained hurricane force winds were located over the Atlantic. At 5 p.m. EDT Floyd was downgraded to a tropical storm as it passed about 10 miles east of Atlantic City.  Between 5 p.m. and 9 p.m. EDT the torrential rain ended across the state from south to north.  The strongest winds associated with Floyd mixed down as cooler air behind the system moved into the region.   For many locations the strongest wind gusts occurred between 4 p.m. and 10 p.m. EDT and the highest gusts occurred over higher terrain locations. Wind gusts rarely exceeded 50 mph, but all the flooding rains made it easier for trees to be knocked over.  Tropical Storm Floyd made landfall again on western Fire Island in Suffolk County,  New York around 8 p.m. EDT and was located near Portland, Maine at 8 a.m. EDT on the 17th. 
 
Somerset County and Bound Brook and Manville specifically were hit the hardest (in the Mount Holly, NJ area of forecast and warning responsibility).  Expressions such as "It's gone.", "It's totaled.", "It's like nothing we've seen before." were used to describe the flooding in downtown Bound Brook.  About 2,000 persons were evacuated, 800 were rescued from second story windows and rooftops in the downtown and west end areas. The downtown was covered by an estimated thirteen feet of water. Flooding stretched from Tea Street to Billian-Legion Park and reached as high as High Street.  Due to an electrical malfunction, a fire broke out in a cluster of stores on Main Street in Bound Brook.  Flood waters prevented firefighters from getting close.  Four stores were gutted, three others were heavily damaged. Borough schools were closed through the 24th.  Main Street was not reopened until October 5th. More than 200 homes were condemned.  Manville was hit equally as hard as 1,000 persons were evacuated from 360 homes in the Lost Valley section.  In all 1,500 homes were damaged and 284 homes were condemned.  The mud line was 10 feet above ground level. Both boroughs are along the Raritan River and the Raritan set new record crests at both locations breaking the previous record set during Tropical Storm Doria on August 28, 1971. Flood waters from the Raritan River also inundated the Elizabethtown Water Company's main water treatment plant in Bridgewater.  About 500,000 customers in Hunterdon, Mercer, Middlesex and Somerset Counties were forced to boil their water and advised not to bathe.  The plant tripping off line also produced low water pressure that affected numerous municipalities. The National Guard delivered more than 500,000 bottles of water. The plant started to pump some water on Monday the 20th, was back to one-third of capacity on the 23rd and cancelled the boiling advisory at 8 p.m. EDT on the 24th.  Many schools and businesses could not open until an adequate and safe water supply returned.  Flooding along the Green Brook pushed up to three feet of sewage contaminated flood waters into the first floor of Green Brook Township's Municipal Building.  In Hillsborough Township 600 homes were damaged and 200 persons were evacuated along the Millstone and Neshanic Rivers. A rescue boat capsized while trying to rescue a man trapped in a tree for two hours.  In Franklin Township, flood waters from the Raritan River reached 10 feet inside the buildings of the Zarapeth Community Church destroying 20,000 volumes of books in its Bible Institute. Damage here alone was estimated at 2.5 million dollars.  Nearly every township had flooded roads and low-lying area evacuations.  Many townships were effectively cut-off. Downed trees exacerbated the damage mainly in the northern part of the county. Seventy-five percent of all the bridges in the county were damaged.  Eight bridges remained closed in Bedminster, Bound Brook, Hillsborough and Montgomery.  Several of them were damaged from logs smashing into them.  Four bridges remained closed on October 19th.  Numerous waterways were contaminated with raw sewage, heating oil and other pollutants.  A 58-year-old building inspector became ill with Legionnaire's Disease during the clean-up.  About 4,400 persons were evacuated throughout the county, 60 persons were still in shelters on October 15th.  Many businesses in downtown Bound Brook and Manville were not expected to reopen.   

Farther downstream in Middlesex County the Raritan River flooding also took its toll.  As the Raritan River was rising, the incoming high tide during the early morning of the 17th prevented it from discharging into the bay.  Around the time of this high tide, the Raritan River caused the worst flooding in memory in Middlesex County.  About 3,300 persons were sheltered as evacuations occurred in New Brunswick, Carteret, Dunellen, Edison, South Brunswick, South Plainfield and Woodbridge. In New Brunswick the Raritan river flooded over New Jersey State Route 18. Flood waters cascaded around the New Brunswick Homes and River Watch Apartment Complexes (about 1,000 persons were evacuated), the New Brunswick Police Department and the New Brunswick Municipal Court.  Neither of the municipal buildings were used again. New Jersey State Route 18 opened the afternoon of the 18th.  Three bridges were closed. The Delaware and Raritan Canal Locks, swing bridge and tow path were damaged.  Severe flooding damage was reported in Highland Park, Middlesex Borough, Piscataway,  South Plainfield and Woodbridge.  In Middlesex Borough  500 homes were damaged and the damage estimate was 6 million dollars.  In Woodbridge, flooded stores were not expected to be reopened for weeks.  In Piscataway where damage estimates reached 5 million dollars, the Riverside, Mayflower and Birchview Apartment Complexes were severely flooded. Parks near the Raritan River were also badly damaged. In Edison, low water pressure problems associated with the Elizabethtown Water Treatment Plant resulted in little or no water for the township through the 20th.  The National Guard was providing water.  Numerous streams flooded throughout the county.  By early afternoon 30 to 40 roads throughout the county were already closed with numerous water rescues from car tops taking place.  Rutgers University canceled classes on both the 16th and 17th.  Downed trees were reported in Metuchen and over 100 homes were damaged by flooding in Dunellen.  Another affect of Floyd was the thousands of barrels and drums (some containing hazardous solvents and acids) were found bobbing in the waters of Raritan and Sandy Hook Bays and washed ashore on local beaches.        

Upstream areas in the Raritan Basin did not fare much better.  In Hunterdon County five homes were destroyed, 117 had major damage and 582 had minor damage.  Two apartments suffered major damage and 7 suffered minor damage. Twenty-four businesses also were damaged.  About 125 persons were evacuated. Five percent of all county roads were damaged and three bridges (In East Amwell, Franklin and Readington Townships) were expected to remain closed through mid November.   Hardest hit was Lambertville, especially the south side of the city near Swan Creek.  Nearly 100 homes were flooded and half the evacuations within the county occurred in this city.  The flooding creek also cracked a water pipe leaving the south side of the city with no water.  Elsewhere the elementary school was flooded with nearly two feet of water (damage estimate 1.1 million) as a creek behind the school overflowed.  The school did not reopen until Tuesday September 28th.  Other streams and rivers flooded in Alexandria, Califon, Frenchtown and Holland Townships.  High winds also damaged two homes in Holland Township and vehicles in Frenchtown Borough.

Elsewhere in Northwest New Jersey, Morris County in the Passaic Basin was hit hard.  It was one of the hardest hit counties with respect to wind damage in the state.  Hundreds of trees were knocked down.  About 1,500 persons were evacuated because of flooding.  Numerous roads were closed including NJ State Routes 10 and 23, U.S. Route 46 and NJ State Route 53.  The hardest hit municipalities were Pequannock and Lincoln Park along the Pompton River.  Flooding caused an estimated 5.5 million dollars to two hundred fifty homes in Pequannock.  One home collapsed and trapped two persons and a dog inside.  They were rescued.  Thirty-five roads alone in Pequannock were closed. Flooding along the Rockaway River caused evacuations in Denville and Dover. Three hundred homes were flooded in Dover.  Flooding along the Whippany River forced the evacuation of 50 families in Morristown and closed 15 roads in Mendham Township. Serious flooding also occurred along the South Branch of the Raritan River in Washington Township, the Loantanka Brook in Harding Township and Terrace Lake in Butler Borough.  Flooding caused the Allen Street Bridge to collapse in Netcong Borough. Numerous trees were knocked down in Boonton, Harding, Mendham, Netcong and Washington Townships.  Dozens of homes were damaged by the fallen trees.  In Mendham Township, 100 foot tall oak trees were snapped.  In Harding Township, 90 percent of the township lost power because of downed trees.  Every house on one block of Millbrook Road had downed trees on it.  School were closed through Friday the 17th throughout most of the county and New Jersey Transit Rail Service was not returned to full operations until Monday the 20th.

On a relative basis the effects of Floyd diminished across Warren and Sussex Counties.  In Franklin Township in Warren County a trailer exploded after flood waters caused a short in the wiring of a propane stove and spread to the tanks outside.  The trailer exploded, but no one was hurt since the trailer park was already evacuated because of flooding.   About 38,000 homes and businesses lost power.  Power was not fully restored until the 21st. Hardest hit were Byram Township, Frankford Township, Hopatcong Borough and the town of Newton.  Flooding caused by Floyd contaminated municipal wells in Andover and Hampton Townships. 

In Central New Jersey, Mercer County was hit the hardest and was also included in the disaster declaration. About 400 persons were evacuated in Ewing and Lawrence Townships and in Trenton.  About 85 major roads were closed including sections of Interstate 95, U.S. Routes 1 and 130 and New Jersey State Route 33. Hundreds of water rescues from trapped vehicles occurred. In Trenton the worst flood damage occurred along the Assunpink Creek.  Forty homes and three businesses were damaged on Mulberry Street, Dickinson Street and North Clinton Avenue. In Ewing Township, about 150 residents were evacuated from the Willow Creek Rehabilitation and Care Center.  In Lawrence Township, six homes were badly damaged (condemned) by flood waters from the Delaware and Raritan Canal.  Businesses, car dealerships and residents near the Shabakunk Creek also suffered flood damage.  U.S. Route 1 buckled. In Princeton, schools were closed until Monday the 20th because of the combination of flood damage and water quality problems stemming from the Elizabethtown Water Company's Bridgewater treatment plant.  High winds took their toll also.  The chimney blew down onto the roof of the Imani Community Church. Pieces of the chimney crashed through the roof.  The replacement cost was estimated at 1 million dollars.

In Monmouth County, the worst flooding related problems occurred around noon EDT as the torrential rain coincided with the high tide. The worst flooding was reported in Union Beach and bay areas of Middletown Township. Mandatory evacuations occurred in Union Beach (which became an island) and voluntary evacuations occurred in Middletown Township along the bay and near Compton's and Pew Creeks. New Jersey State Routes 35 and 36 were closed due to flooding.  Farther inland, Manalapan Township was hardest hit with overflowing brooks that forced the closure of six roads and sandbagging of homes on Birmingham Road.  The strongest winds occurred during the evening and blew down transformers, wires, tree limbs and several trees throughout the county. Coastal areas escaped with minimal damage: just some minor beach erosion and minor back bay flooding at times of high tide. Thousands of barrels and drums (some containing hazardous solvents and acids) were found bobbing in the waters of Raritan and Sandy Hook Bays and washed ashore on local beaches.  
 
Across the southern half of New Jersey, the heaviest rain and the most widespread flooding occurred in townships along the Delaware River.  Less rain and flooding occurred farther southeast with less urban and poor drainage flooding and only minor beach erosion and back bay flooding reported in Atlantic, Cape May and Ocean Counties. The worst flooding occurred along some of the larger waterways in the area (Cooper River in Camden County, Rancocas Creek in Burlington County) and along tidal sections of tributaries to the Delaware River. This peaked during the evening high tide as winds funneled into the bay and brought higher tidal departures and slowed the discharge of inland waterways. The high tide in Philadelphia reached 9.4 feet above mean lower low water at around 640 p.m. EDT.  Moderate tidal flooding starts at 9.2 feet above mean lower low water. In Burlington County, some evacuations occurred in Riverside around the Delanco-Riverside Bridge.  The bridge was also closed.  Farther upstream along the Rancocas Creek the Centerton Bridge in Willingboro was closed.  Voluntary evacuations also occurred along the Delaware River in Delran and roads near the Rancocas Creek were closed.  Several evacuations also occurred along the Assicunk Creek in Burlington City.  Creek flooding (mainly the Rancocas) occurred in Medford, Mount Holly and Westampton Townships.  About 10 roads in the county were closed due to flooding.  In Camden County the worst flooding occurred in Collingswood along U.S. Route 130 between the Airport Circle and Collings Avenue.  Some homes were flooded and evacuated as raw sewage was present.  Flooding from Floyd knocked out a state psychiatric hospital's wastewater treatment plant in Winslow Township.  Downed trees damaged a home in Blackwood Township. In Gloucester County, about 40 persons were evacuated in Gibbstown after the Gibbstown Levee partially gave way and sent water from the Delaware River and Repaupo Creek into Gibbstown.  In adjacent Logan Township, about 20 persons were evacuated near Floodgate Road.  There were also additional voluntary evacuations in low-lying areas of both Logan and Monroe Townships. Sections of U.S. Route 130 were closed. One road collapsed in Woolwich Township and the torrential rain contributed to a fatal accident on the New Jersey Turnpike. In Salem County, tidal flooding occurred in Penns Grove.  A 40-year-old man died when he fell into the Salem near Pennsville.  Several dam failures occurred. In Cumberland County, 3,700 persons living in mobile home parks in Vineland were evacuated.  Farmers also feared that the heavy rain would ruin the fall spinach crop.  In Ocean County, elderly residents of Laurelton Gardens in Brick Township were evacuated after a creek flooded.  Scattered trees and wires were knocked down throughout the county.  A tree damaged a house in Toms River.

As Hurricane Isabel moved northwest toward the southern Mid Atlantic States, a strong high pressure system built over Northern New England.  As the pressure gradient increased, strong northeast winds developed across the region Thursday, September 18th.  Hurricane Isabel made landfall near Drum Inlet, North Carolina at 1 pm on the eighteenth. As Isabel accelerated toward the north northwest, tropical storm force winds rapidly expanded north.  Tropical storm force winds of 39 miles per hour (mph) occurred across parts of Union, Essex, and Hudson Counties from Thursday evening through Thursday night. Elsewhere, east winds were sustained between 25 and 35 mph with peak gusts between 35 and 45 mph. When strong winds were accompanied by bands of heavy showers, many trees, tree limbs, and power lines were downed across the region.  The greatest damage occurred across Union, Essex, and Hudson Counties.  In Union County, high winds downed many trees and wires, which resulted in the closure of major streets and schools.  In Hudson County, several trees fell onto and damaged cars.

These strong winds resulted in 3 injuries in Bergen County:

In Englewood, police reported that a 31 year old woman was injured when winds toppled a tree onto her car on Tenafly Road.

In East Rutherford, police reported that a 12th floor window blew out at the Metromedia building across from Giants Stadium.  The glass struck and injured 2 women. 

Here are selected wind velocity measurements across the region:

In Essex County, the Automated Surface Observing System (ASOS) at Newark Airport measured a sustained 2 minute wind velocity of 32 mph from 100 degrees at 1:19 am EDT on the 19th with a peak gust to 44 mph from 120 degrees at 2:43 am EDT on the 19th.

Irene is expected to be the costliest natural disaster in the history of New Jersey. Approximately one million people were evacuated from the coast and low lying areas prone to inland flooding throughout the state of New Jersey including all of Cape May County. Irene also caused record breaking outages to utility customers as around one and a half million people lost power throughout the state. Power was not fully restored until September 5th. The widespread flooding resulted in the second highest crest (highest was with Hurricane Floyd in September 1999) on record for the Raritan Basin, but the highest crest on record for many other river basins including the Passaic. Moderate tidal flooding occurred along the tidal Delaware River and Delaware Bay and minor to moderate flooding occurred farther north along the Delaware River. Moderate to severe tidal flooding occurred along the Atlantic Coast and Raritan Bay There were six direct deaths associated with Irene, all drownings. The deaths occurred in Salem County, Mercer County (two), Ocean County (two) and Morris County. Preliminary damage estimates in the whole state of New Jersey were near one billion dollars to approximately 200,000 homes and businesses. The closure of the Atlantic City casinos (only the third time in history) for three days caused an estimated 45 million dollars in lost revenue.   The combination of wind and flooding forced the closure of about 350 main roadways in the state including sections of Interstate 287, the Garden State Parkway and the New Jersey Turnpike. The flooding rains and winds damaged the corn, peach, pumpkin, tomato,  pepper, cucumber, potato and squash crops and feared will damage the blueberry crop in 2012. Drug industry production fell the week of August 29th because of traveling problems. Free ice and water were distributed in locations with widespread power outages. The American Red Cross distributed over 1,000 clean-up kits and 100,000 meals and snacks.   ||Tropical storm force wind gusts overspread New Jersey during the late afternoon and evening of the 27th and persisted through the afternoon of the 28th. Peak wind gusts averaged around 50 mph inland and around 65 mph at the coast. The strongest winds associated with Irene occurred at two distinct times. The first surge occurred during bands of heavier rain during the evening of the 27th and early morning of the 28th. The second peak occurred during the afternoon of the 28th when skies were clearing and deeper mixing of the atmosphere brought stronger winds to the ground. Most of the inland peak wind gusts occurred at this time. The rain associated with Irene overspread New Jersey during the late morning on the 27th, fell at its heaviest during the evening of the 27th into the early morning of the 28th and ended during the early afternoon on the 28th. Event precipitation totals averaged 5 to 10 inches and caused widespread record breaking flooding. Many locations broke August's all time monthly rainfall records even before Irene arrived. Because the flash flooding and flooding blended into one, all flooding related Stormdata county entries were combined into one under flood events. The storm surge of 3 to 5 feet caused moderate to severe tidal flooding along the ocean side and moderate tidal flooding in Delaware Bay and tidal sections of the Delaware River. The tidal flooding was during the evening and overnight high tide on the 27th across southern New Jersey, Delaware Bay and the Delaware River, but with the morning high on the 28th in Northern New Jersey. The morning high tide coincided closer with the high tide cycle and caused most of the severe tidal flooding to occur there.  Minor tidal flooding persisted in tidal sections of the Delaware River during the high tide cycles from the 29th through the 31st. ||Governor Chris Christie declared a state of emergency on August 25th. New Jersey Transit rail, bus and light rail operations were suspended on the weekend of the 27th and 28th. Full transit service was not restored until Wednesday August 31st.  In Cape May County, countywide mandatory evacuations were ordered on August 25th, and for residents the next day. Traffic on New Jersey State Route 55 south of Vineland, New Jersey Route 47 and New Jersey Route 347 were only allowed to head north leaving Cape May County.||All Atlantic County shore communities east of U.S. Route 9 including Atlantic City were placed under a voluntary evacuation at 8 p.m. August 25th and the following day a mandatory evacuation effective starting 6 a.m. EDT. All Atlantic City casinos were shut down as the city faced the first mandatory evacuation in history. About 1,500 National Guard troops had been deployed in the state to help with evacuations.  In Ocean County, all of the barrier islands including Long Beach Island were under mandatory evacuation starting at 8 a.m. EDT on August 26th.  To relieve evacuation traffic, toll operations were temporarily suspended on the Garden State Parkway south of the Raritan River and on the Atlantic City Expressway. The southbound lanes on the Garden State Parkway south of exit 98 were closed at 8 p.m. EDT on August 26th, while eastbound traffic was stopped on New Jersey State Routes 70 and Route 72.||Major flooding occurred on the Raritan, Millstone, Rockaway and Passaic Rivers.  Record flows were reported at the Musconetcong River in Warren County as well as the Assunpink Creek in Mercer County and the Rancocas Creek in Burlington County. Flooding on the rivers lasted as long as September 5th. The flooding affected and closed   numerous roads, including the heavily used Interstate 287 in Boonton when the northbound shoulder collapsed from the force of the Rockaway River. The Garden State Parkway flooded in Toms River near exit 98. On Monday August 29th, eighty roadways were still closed and thirty-six roadways were still closed on the 30th.  Ninety-eight percent of the closed roadways were reopened as of September 1st.  Coupled with a reduced transit schedule, travel was described as gridlock on the 29th   Thousands of homes were also flooded, especially in Morris and Somerset Counties. Many northern New Jersey schools that were scheduled to open on the 29th were closed. ||At the Trenton Train Station along Assunpink Creek, flooding impacted Amtrak's Northeast Corridor, SEPTA's Trenton Line, and New Jersey Transit's (NJT) Northeast Corridor Rail Line. Service was not fully restored to and through Trenton until August 31st. Irene cost NJT just under $10 million in lost revenue and damaged infrastructure. Numerous homes suffered structural damages from the winds, and limbs impacting their roofs. ||In total, approximately 1.6 million customers of JCP&L and PSE&G throughout the state lost power. Two days after the storm, 500,000 PSE&G customers were still without power, down from a peak of about 928,000. By September 3 power had been restored to all but 750, but thousands of JCP&L customers were still without service. On September 2nd, 37,000 JCP&L customers were awaiting restoration of service. On Sunday September 5, power had been returned to last remaining 2,000 residents who suffered a power outage. ||There was one confirmed tornado in Mercer County, but widespread tree wind damage (and damage to homes and vehicles when trees fell on them) occurred in every county.  In addition, a few municipalities experienced stronger wind bursts that caused direct property damage. The strong winds forced the suspension of service on the Cape May Lewes Ferry.  In Monmouth County, in Long Branch, the high winds damaged two roofs of an apartment complex on Ocean Boulevard.  In Ocean County, an estimated 500 trees were knocked down.  The SpongeBob ride at the Funtown Pier in Seaside Park was damaged. In Atlantic County, a piece of an exterior wall of the Borgota Hotel was blown off.  In Gloucester County, a 61-year-old woman suffered a head injury after being struck by a tree. ||The shore took a pounding from the coastal flooding and heavy surf. A 25-year-old and a 24-year-old man drowned in Point Pleasant (Ocean County) after going to the shore to view the storm. The average sand loss was about four to five feet high and one hundred fifty feet wide.  Waves were estimated to reach as high as 12 feet as offshore seas reached 25 feet. There were numerous reports of dune fence damage and sand overwashes onto streets and boardwalks. Along the Raritan Bay side of Middlesex and Monmouth Counties, most of the vertical cuts were less than two feet and no breaches were reported. In Keansburg and Union Beach in Monmouth County low lying bayshore communities experienced tidal flooding. About 3,000 county residents were evacuated along Raritan Bay. Along the Atlantic Ocean side of Monmouth County, vertical cuts averaged 2 to 5 feet. In Spring Lake, about one and a half miles of the borough���s boardwalk was damaged and closed. In Ocean County, vertical cuts averaged 2 to 4 feet north of Barnegat Light and 4 to 6 feet south of Barnegat Light. A dune cut was reported in Harvey Cedars. Dune washovers occurred in Brant Beach. In Beach Haven, dune cuts reached 10 feet and the geotubes at Merrivale Avenue were overtopped. No flood damage to homes was reported. The entrance to the Holgate Natural Area was impassable as stone and rubble were exposed. In Atlantic County, vertical cuts averaged 1 to 4 feet, but reached 6 feet in Brigantine. In Cape May County, vertical cuts averaged 2 to 4 feet. A couple of horizontal dune cuts occurred in North Wildwood and the top cap of a timber bulkhead was knocked off. In Cape May City, a horizontal dune cut occurred on Poverty Beach. | |President Barack Obama initially declared the state a disaster area, making residents of Bergen, Essex, Morris, Passaic and Somerset Counties and made them eligible for federal aid.

It moved northeast and passed over Puerto Rico overnight on the 21st. As Irene moved off the island, it intensified into a hurricane. Irene just bypassed the island of Hispaniola to its north and then passed over the Eastern Bahamas on the 25th as it reached category three hurricane strength. From the Bahamas, Irene moved nearly due north and slowly weakened to a category two hurricane on the 26th and a category one hurricane on the 27th. Irene made her initial landfall near Cape Lookout, North Carolina at 8 a.m. EDT on the 27th as a category one and then proceeded to the northnortheast. Irene went back over the Atlantic Ocean near the Virginia and North Carolina border at 7 p.m. EDT on the 27th. From there Irene paralleled the Delmarva Peninsula and the center passed about 15 miles east of Delaware between 3 a.m. and 4 a.m. EDT on the 28th. Irene continued to slowly weaken and made her second landfall as a tropical storm on Brigantine Island, just north of Atlantic City, New Jersey at 535 a.m. EDT on the 28th. From there the center of Irene moved along eastern parts of Ocean and Monmouth Counties and was located near Tinton Falls Township in Monmouth County at 8 a.m. EDT on the 28th.

In Monmouth County, in Long Branch, the high winds damaged two roofs of an apartment complex on Ocean Boulevard.  In Ocean County, an estimated 500 trees were knocked down.  The SpongeBob ride at the Funtown Pier in Seaside Park was damaged. In Atlantic County, a piece of an exterior wall of the Borgota Hotel was blown off.  In Gloucester County, a 61-year-old woman suffered a head injury after being struck by a tree. ||The shore took a pounding from the coastal flooding and heavy surf. A 25-year-old and a 24-year-old man drowned in Point Pleasant (Ocean County) after going to the shore to view the storm. The average sand loss was about four to five feet high and one hundred fifty feet wide.  Waves were estimated to reach as high as 12 feet as offshore seas reached 25 feet. There were numerous reports of dune fence damage and sand overwashes onto streets and boardwalks. Along the Raritan Bay side of Middlesex and Monmouth Counties, most of the vertical cuts were less than two feet and no breaches were reported. In Keansburg and Union Beach in Monmouth County low lying bayshore communities experienced tidal flooding. About 3,000 county residents were evacuated along Raritan Bay. Along the Atlantic Ocean side of Monmouth County, vertical cuts averaged 2 to 5 feet. In Spring Lake, about one and a half miles of the borough���s boardwalk was damaged and closed. In Ocean County, vertical cuts averaged 2 to 4 feet north of Barnegat Light and 4 to 6 feet south of Barnegat Light. A dune cut was reported in Harvey Cedars. Dune washovers occurred in Brant Beach. In Beach Haven, dune cuts reached 10 feet and the geotubes at Merrivale Avenue were overtopped. No flood damage to homes was reported. The entrance to the Holgate Natural Area was impassable as stone and rubble were exposed. In Atlantic County, vertical cuts averaged 1 to 4 feet, but reached 6 feet in Brigantine. In Cape May County, vertical cuts averaged 2 to 4 feet. A couple of horizontal dune cuts occurred in North Wildwood and the top cap of a timber bulkhead was knocked off. In Cape May City, a horizontal dune cut occurred on Poverty Beach. | |President Barack Obama initially declared the state a disaster area, making residents of Bergen, Essex, Morris, Passaic and Somerset Counties and made them eligible for federal aid.

It moved northeast and passed over Puerto Rico overnight on the 21st. As Irene moved off the island, it intensified into a hurricane. Irene just bypassed the island of Hispaniola to its north and then passed over the Eastern Bahamas on the 25th as it reached category three hurricane strength. From the Bahamas, Irene moved nearly due north and slowly weakened to a category two hurricane on the 26th and a category one hurricane on the 27th. Irene made her initial landfall near Cape Lookout, North Carolina at 8 a.m. EDT on the 27th as a category one and then proceeded to the northnortheast. Irene went back over the Atlantic Ocean near the Virginia and North Carolina border at 7 p.m. EDT on the 27th. From there Irene paralleled the Delmarva Peninsula and the center passed about 15 miles east of Delaware between 3 a.m. and 4 a.m. EDT on the 28th. Irene continued to slowly weaken and made her second landfall as a tropical storm on Brigantine Island, just north of Atlantic City, New Jersey at 535 a.m. EDT on the 28th. From there the center of Irene moved along eastern parts of Ocean and Monmouth Counties and was located near Tinton Falls Township in Monmouth County at 8 a.m. EDT on the 28th. At about 9 a.m. EDT the center of Irene passed over New York City.||Irene helped make August 2011 the wettest August on record for the state of New Jersey dating back to 1895.

Irene is expected to be the costliest natural disaster in the history of New Jersey. Approximately one million people were evacuated from the coast and low lying areas prone to inland flooding throughout the state of New Jersey including all of Cape May County. Irene also caused record breaking outages to utility customers as around one and a half million people lost power throughout the state. Power was not fully restored until September 5th. The widespread flooding resulted in the second highest crest (highest was with Hurricane Floyd in September 1999) on record for the Raritan Basin, but the highest crest on record for many other river basins including the Passaic. Moderate tidal flooding occurred along the tidal Delaware River and Delaware Bay and minor to moderate flooding occurred farther north along the Delaware River. Moderate to severe tidal flooding occurred along the Atlantic Coast and Raritan Bay There were six direct deaths associated with Irene, all drownings. The deaths occurred in Salem County, Mercer County (two), Ocean County (two) and Morris County. Preliminary damage estimates in the whole state of New Jersey were near one billion dollars to approximately 200,000 homes and businesses. The closure of the Atlantic City casinos (only the third time in history) for three days caused an estimated 45 million dollars in lost revenue.   The combination of wind and flooding forced the closure of about 350 main roadways in the state including sections of Interstate 287, the Garden State Parkway and the New Jersey Turnpike. The flooding rains and winds damaged the corn, peach, pumpkin, tomato,  pepper, cucumber, potato and squash crops and feared will damage the blueberry crop in 2012. Drug industry production fell the week of August 29th because of traveling problems. Free ice and water were distributed in locations with widespread power outages. The American Red Cross distributed over 1,000 clean-up kits and 100,000 meals and snacks.   ||Tropical storm force wind gusts overspread New Jersey during the late afternoon and evening of the 27th and persisted through the afternoon of the 28th. Peak wind gusts averaged around 50 mph inland and around 65 mph at the coast. The strongest winds associated with Irene occurred at two distinct times. The first surge occurred during bands of heavier rain during the evening of the 27th and early morning of the 28th. The second peak occurred during the afternoon of the 28th when skies were clearing and deeper mixing of the atmosphere brought stronger winds to the ground. Most of the inland peak wind gusts occurred at this time. The rain associated with Irene overspread New Jersey during the late morning on the 27th, fell at its heaviest during the evening of the 27th into the early morning of the 28th and ended during the early afternoon on the 28th. Event precipitation totals averaged 5 to 10 inches and caused widespread record breaking flooding. Many locations broke August's all time monthly rainfall records even before Irene arrived. Because the flash flooding and flooding blended into one, all flooding related Stormdata county entries were combined into one under flood events. The storm surge of 3 to 5 feet caused moderate to severe tidal flooding along the ocean side and moderate tidal flooding in Delaware Bay and tidal sections of the Delaware River. The tidal flooding was during the evening and overnight high tide on the 27th across southern New Jersey, Delaware Bay and the Delaware River, but with the morning high on the 28th in Northern New Jersey. The morning high tide coincided closer with the high tide cycle and caused most of the severe tidal flooding to occur there.  Minor tidal flooding persisted in tidal sections of the Delaware River during the high tide cycles from the 29th through the 31st. ||Governor Chris Christie declared a state of emergency on August 25th. New Jersey Transit rail, bus and light rail operations were suspended on the weekend of the 27th and 28th. Full transit service was not restored until Wednesday August 31st.  In Cape May County, countywide mandatory evacuations were ordered on August 25th, and for residents the next day. Traffic on New Jersey State Route 55 south of Vineland, New Jersey Route 47 and New Jersey Route 347 were only allowed to head north leaving Cape May County.||All Atlantic County shore communities east of U.S. Route 9 including Atlantic City were placed under a voluntary evacuation at 8 p.m. August 25th and the following day a mandatory evacuation effective starting 6 a.m. EDT. All Atlantic City casinos were shut down as the city faced the first mandatory evacuation in history. About 1,500 National Guard troops had been deployed in the state to help with evacuations.  In Ocean County, all of the barrier islands including Long Beach Island were under mandatory evacuation starting at 8 a.m. EDT on August 26th.  To relieve evacuation traffic, toll operations were temporarily suspended on the Garden State Parkway south of the Raritan River and on the Atlantic City Expressway. The southbound lanes on the Garden State Parkway south of exit 98 were closed at 8 p.m. EDT on August 26th, while eastbound traffic was stopped on New Jersey State Routes 70 and Route 72.||Major flooding occurred on the Raritan, Millstone, Rockaway and Passaic Rivers.  Record flows were reported at the Musconetcong River in Warren County as well as the Assunpink Creek in Mercer County and the Rancocas Creek in Burlington County. Flooding on the rivers lasted as long as September 5th. The flooding affected and closed   numerous roads, including the heavily used Interstate 287 in Boonton when the northbound shoulder collapsed from the force of the Rockaway River. The Garden State Parkway flooded in Toms River near exit 98. On Monday August 29th, eighty roadways were still closed and thirty-six roadways were still closed on the 30th.  Ninety-eight percent of the closed roadways were reopened as of September 1st.  Coupled with a reduced transit schedule, travel was described as gridlock on the 29th   Thousands of homes were also flooded, especially in Morris and Somerset Counties. Many northern New Jersey schools that were scheduled to open on the 29th were closed. ||At the Trenton Train Station along Assunpink Creek, flooding impacted Amtrak's Northeast Corridor, SEPTA's Trenton Line, and New Jersey Transit's (NJT) Northeast Corridor Rail Line. Service was not fully restored to and through Trenton until August 31st. Irene cost NJT just under $10 million in lost revenue and damaged infrastructure. Numerous homes suffered structural damages from the winds, and limbs impacting their roofs. ||In total, approximately 1.6 million customers of JCP&L and PSE&G throughout the state lost power. Two days after the storm, 500,000 PSE&G customers were still without power, down from a peak of about 928,000. By September 3 power had been restored to all but 750, but thousands of JCP&L customers were still without service. On September 2nd, 37,000 JCP&L customers were awaiting restoration of service.

From there Irene paralleled the Delmarva Peninsula and the center passed about 15 miles east of Delaware between 3 a.m. and 4 a.m. EDT on the 28th. Irene continued to slowly weaken and made her second landfall as a tropical storm on Brigantine Island, just north of Atlantic City, New Jersey at 535 a.m. EDT on the 28th. From there the center of Irene moved along eastern parts of Ocean and Monmouth Counties and was located near Tinton Falls Township in Monmouth County at 8 a.m. EDT on the 28th. At about 9 a.m. EDT the center of Irene passed over New York City.||Irene helped make August 2011 the wettest August on record for the state of New Jersey dating back to 1895.

Irene is expected to be the costliest natural disaster in the history of New Jersey. Approximately one million people were evacuated from the coast and low lying areas prone to inland flooding throughout the state of New Jersey including all of Cape May County. Irene also caused record breaking outages to utility customers as around one and a half million people lost power throughout the state. Power was not fully restored until September 5th. The widespread flooding resulted in the second highest crest (highest was with Hurricane Floyd in September 1999) on record for the Raritan Basin, but the highest crest on record for many other river basins including the Passaic. Moderate tidal flooding occurred along the tidal Delaware River and Delaware Bay and minor to moderate flooding occurred farther north along the Delaware River. Moderate to severe tidal flooding occurred along the Atlantic Coast and Raritan Bay There were six direct deaths associated with Irene, all drownings. The deaths occurred in Salem County, Mercer County (two), Ocean County (two) and Morris County. Preliminary damage estimates in the whole state of New Jersey were near one billion dollars to approximately 200,000 homes and businesses. The closure of the Atlantic City casinos (only the third time in history) for three days caused an estimated 45 million dollars in lost revenue.   The combination of wind and flooding forced the closure of about 350 main roadways in the state including sections of Interstate 287, the Garden State Parkway and the New Jersey Turnpike. The flooding rains and winds damaged the corn, peach, pumpkin, tomato,  pepper, cucumber, potato and squash crops and feared will damage the blueberry crop in 2012. Drug industry production fell the week of August 29th because of traveling problems. Free ice and water were distributed in locations with widespread power outages. The American Red Cross distributed over 1,000 clean-up kits and 100,000 meals and snacks.   ||Tropical storm force wind gusts overspread New Jersey during the late afternoon and evening of the 27th and persisted through the afternoon of the 28th. Peak wind gusts averaged around 50 mph inland and around 65 mph at the coast. The strongest winds associated with Irene occurred at two distinct times. The first surge occurred during bands of heavier rain during the evening of the 27th and early morning of the 28th. The second peak occurred during the afternoon of the 28th when skies were clearing and deeper mixing of the atmosphere brought stronger winds to the ground. Most of the inland peak wind gusts occurred at this time. The rain associated with Irene overspread New Jersey during the late morning on the 27th, fell at its heaviest during the evening of the 27th into the early morning of the 28th and ended during the early afternoon on the 28th. Event precipitation totals averaged 5 to 10 inches and caused widespread record breaking flooding. Many locations broke August's all time monthly rainfall records even before Irene arrived. Because the flash flooding and flooding blended into one, all flooding related Stormdata county entries were combined into one under flood events. The storm surge of 3 to 5 feet caused moderate to severe tidal flooding along the ocean side and moderate tidal flooding in Delaware Bay and tidal sections of the Delaware River. The tidal flooding was during the evening and overnight high tide on the 27th across southern New Jersey, Delaware Bay and the Delaware River, but with the morning high on the 28th in Northern New Jersey. The morning high tide coincided closer with the high tide cycle and caused most of the severe tidal flooding to occur there.  Minor tidal flooding persisted in tidal sections of the Delaware River during the high tide cycles from the 29th through the 31st. ||Governor Chris Christie declared a state of emergency on August 25th. New Jersey Transit rail, bus and light rail operations were suspended on the weekend of the 27th and 28th. Full transit service was not restored until Wednesday August 31st.  In Cape May County, countywide mandatory evacuations were ordered on August 25th, and for residents the next day. Traffic on New Jersey State Route 55 south of Vineland, New Jersey Route 47 and New Jersey Route 347 were only allowed to head north leaving Cape May County.||All Atlantic County shore communities east of U.S. Route 9 including Atlantic City were placed under a voluntary evacuation at 8 p.m. August 25th and the following day a mandatory evacuation effective starting 6 a.m. EDT. All Atlantic City casinos were shut down as the city faced the first mandatory evacuation in history. About 1,500 National Guard troops had been deployed in the state to help with evacuations.  In Ocean County, all of the barrier islands including Long Beach Island were under mandatory evacuation starting at 8 a.m. EDT on August 26th.  To relieve evacuation traffic, toll operations were temporarily suspended on the Garden State Parkway south of the Raritan River and on the Atlantic City Expressway. The southbound lanes on the Garden State Parkway south of exit 98 were closed at 8 p.m. EDT on August 26th, while eastbound traffic was stopped on New Jersey State Routes 70 and Route 72.||Major flooding occurred on the Raritan, Millstone, Rockaway and Passaic Rivers.  Record flows were reported at the Musconetcong River in Warren County as well as the Assunpink Creek in Mercer County and the Rancocas Creek in Burlington County. Flooding on the rivers lasted as long as September 5th. The flooding affected and closed   numerous roads, including the heavily used Interstate 287 in Boonton when the northbound shoulder collapsed from the force of the Rockaway River. The Garden State Parkway flooded in Toms River near exit 98. On Monday August 29th, eighty roadways were still closed and thirty-six roadways were still closed on the 30th.  Ninety-eight percent of the closed roadways were reopened as of September 1st.  Coupled with a reduced transit schedule, travel was described as gridlock on the 29th   Thousands of homes were also flooded, especially in Morris and Somerset Counties. Many northern New Jersey schools that were scheduled to open on the 29th were closed. ||At the Trenton Train Station along Assunpink Creek, flooding impacted Amtrak's Northeast Corridor, SEPTA's Trenton Line, and New Jersey Transit's (NJT) Northeast Corridor Rail Line. Service was not fully restored to and through Trenton until August 31st. Irene cost NJT just under $10 million in lost revenue and damaged infrastructure. Numerous homes suffered structural damages from the winds, and limbs impacting their roofs. ||In total, approximately 1.6 million customers of JCP&L and PSE&G throughout the state lost power. Two days after the storm, 500,000 PSE&G customers were still without power, down from a peak of about 928,000. By September 3 power had been restored to all but 750, but thousands of JCP&L customers were still without service. On September 2nd, 37,000 JCP&L customers were awaiting restoration of service. On Sunday September 5, power had been returned to last remaining 2,000 residents who suffered a power outage. ||There was one confirmed tornado in Mercer County, but widespread tree wind damage (and damage to homes and vehicles when trees fell on them) occurred in every county.  In addition, a few municipalities experienced stronger wind bursts that caused direct property damage. The strong winds forced the suspension of service on the Cape May Lewes Ferry.  In Monmouth County, in Long Branch, the high winds damaged two roofs of an apartment complex on Ocean Boulevard.  In Ocean County, an estimated 500 trees were knocked down.  The SpongeBob ride at the Funtown Pier in Seaside Park was damaged. In Atlantic County, a piece of an exterior wall of the Borgota Hotel was blown off.  In Gloucester County, a 61-year-old woman suffered a head injury after being struck by a tree. ||The shore took a pounding from the coastal flooding and heavy surf. A 25-year-old and a 24-year-old man drowned in Point Pleasant (Ocean County) after going to the shore to view the storm. The average sand loss was about four to five feet high and one hundred fifty feet wide.  Waves were estimated to reach as high as 12 feet as offshore seas reached 25 feet. There were numerous reports of dune fence damage and sand overwashes onto streets and boardwalks. Along the Raritan Bay side of Middlesex and Monmouth Counties, most of the vertical cuts were less than two feet and no breaches were reported. In Keansburg and Union Beach in Monmouth County low lying bayshore communities experienced tidal flooding. About 3,000 county residents were evacuated along Raritan Bay. Along the Atlantic Ocean side of Monmouth County, vertical cuts averaged 2 to 5 feet. In Spring Lake, about one and a half miles of the borough���s boardwalk was damaged and closed. In Ocean County, vertical cuts averaged 2 to 4 feet north of Barnegat Light and 4 to 6 feet south of Barnegat Light. A dune cut was reported in Harvey Cedars. Dune washovers occurred in Brant Beach. In Beach Haven, dune cuts reached 10 feet and the geotubes at Merrivale Avenue were overtopped. No flood damage to homes was reported. The entrance to the Holgate Natural Area was impassable as stone and rubble were exposed. In Atlantic County, vertical cuts averaged 1 to 4 feet, but reached 6 feet in Brigantine. In Cape May County, vertical cuts averaged 2 to 4 feet. A couple of horizontal dune cuts occurred in North Wildwood and the top cap of a timber bulkhead was knocked off. In Cape May City, a horizontal dune cut occurred on Poverty Beach. | |President Barack Obama initially declared the state a disaster area, making residents of Bergen, Essex, Morris, Passaic and Somerset Counties and made them eligible for federal aid.

Record flows were reported at the Musconetcong River in Warren County as well as the Assunpink Creek in Mercer County and the Rancocas Creek in Burlington County. Flooding on the rivers lasted as long as September 5th. The flooding affected and closed   numerous roads, including the heavily used Interstate 287 in Boonton when the northbound shoulder collapsed from the force of the Rockaway River. The Garden State Parkway flooded in Toms River near exit 98. On Monday August 29th, eighty roadways were still closed and thirty-six roadways were still closed on the 30th.  Ninety-eight percent of the closed roadways were reopened as of September 1st.  Coupled with a reduced transit schedule, travel was described as gridlock on the 29th   Thousands of homes were also flooded, especially in Morris and Somerset Counties. Many northern New Jersey schools that were scheduled to open on the 29th were closed. ||At the Trenton Train Station along Assunpink Creek, flooding impacted Amtrak's Northeast Corridor, SEPTA's Trenton Line, and New Jersey Transit's (NJT) Northeast Corridor Rail Line. Service was not fully restored to and through Trenton until August 31st. Irene cost NJT just under $10 million in lost revenue and damaged infrastructure. Numerous homes suffered structural damages from the winds, and limbs impacting their roofs. ||In total, approximately 1.6 million customers of JCP&L and PSE&G throughout the state lost power. Two days after the storm, 500,000 PSE&G customers were still without power, down from a peak of about 928,000. By September 3 power had been restored to all but 750, but thousands of JCP&L customers were still without service. On September 2nd, 37,000 JCP&L customers were awaiting restoration of service. On Sunday September 5, power had been returned to last remaining 2,000 residents who suffered a power outage. ||There was one confirmed tornado in Mercer County, but widespread tree wind damage (and damage to homes and vehicles when trees fell on them) occurred in every county.  In addition, a few municipalities experienced stronger wind bursts that caused direct property damage. The strong winds forced the suspension of service on the Cape May Lewes Ferry.  In Monmouth County, in Long Branch, the high winds damaged two roofs of an apartment complex on Ocean Boulevard.  In Ocean County, an estimated 500 trees were knocked down.  The SpongeBob ride at the Funtown Pier in Seaside Park was damaged. In Atlantic County, a piece of an exterior wall of the Borgota Hotel was blown off.  In Gloucester County, a 61-year-old woman suffered a head injury after being struck by a tree. ||The shore took a pounding from the coastal flooding and heavy surf. A 25-year-old and a 24-year-old man drowned in Point Pleasant (Ocean County) after going to the shore to view the storm. The average sand loss was about four to five feet high and one hundred fifty feet wide.  Waves were estimated to reach as high as 12 feet as offshore seas reached 25 feet. There were numerous reports of dune fence damage and sand overwashes onto streets and boardwalks. Along the Raritan Bay side of Middlesex and Monmouth Counties, most of the vertical cuts were less than two feet and no breaches were reported. In Keansburg and Union Beach in Monmouth County low lying bayshore communities experienced tidal flooding. About 3,000 county residents were evacuated along Raritan Bay. Along the Atlantic Ocean side of Monmouth County, vertical cuts averaged 2 to 5 feet. In Spring Lake, about one and a half miles of the borough���s boardwalk was damaged and closed. In Ocean County, vertical cuts averaged 2 to 4 feet north of Barnegat Light and 4 to 6 feet south of Barnegat Light. A dune cut was reported in Harvey Cedars. Dune washovers occurred in Brant Beach. In Beach Haven, dune cuts reached 10 feet and the geotubes at Merrivale Avenue were overtopped. No flood damage to homes was reported. The entrance to the Holgate Natural Area was impassable as stone and rubble were exposed. In Atlantic County, vertical cuts averaged 1 to 4 feet, but reached 6 feet in Brigantine. In Cape May County, vertical cuts averaged 2 to 4 feet. A couple of horizontal dune cuts occurred in North Wildwood and the top cap of a timber bulkhead was knocked off.

Along tidal sections of the Delaware River, Big Timber Creek flooded along the Gloucester and Camden County lines and about 300 homes in Burlington City (Burlington County) had flooded basements.   ||Hurricane Irene formed east of the Leeward Islands on Saturday the 20th. It moved northeast and passed over Puerto Rico overnight on the 21st. As Irene moved off the island, it intensified into a hurricane. Irene just bypassed the island of Hispaniola to its north and then passed over the Eastern Bahamas on the 25th as it reached category three hurricane strength. From the Bahamas, Irene moved nearly due north and slowly weakened to a category two hurricane on the 26th and a category one hurricane on the 27th. Irene made her initial landfall near Cape Lookout, North Carolina at 8 a.m. EDT on the 27th as a category one and then proceeded to the northnortheast. Irene went back over the Atlantic Ocean near the Virginia and North Carolina border at 7 p.m. EDT on the 27th. From there Irene paralleled the Delmarva Peninsula and the center passed about 15 miles east of Delaware between 3 a.m. and 4 a.m. EDT on the 28th. Irene continued to slowly weaken and made her second landfall as a tropical storm on Brigantine Island, just north of Atlantic City, New Jersey at 535 a.m. EDT on the 28th. From there the center of Irene moved along eastern parts of Ocean and Monmouth Counties and was located near Tinton Falls Township in Monmouth County at 8 a.m. EDT on the 28th. At about 9 a.m. EDT the center of Irene passed over New York City.||Irene helped make August 2011 the wettest August on record for the state of New Jersey dating back to 1895.

Irene is expected to be the costliest natural disaster in the history of New Jersey. Approximately one million people were evacuated from the coast and low lying areas prone to inland flooding throughout the state of New Jersey including all of Cape May County. Irene also caused record breaking outages to utility customers as around one and a half million people lost power throughout the state. Power was not fully restored until September 5th. The widespread flooding resulted in the second highest crest (highest was with Hurricane Floyd in September 1999) on record for the Raritan Basin, but the highest crest on record for many other river basins including the Passaic. Moderate tidal flooding occurred along the tidal Delaware River and Delaware Bay and minor to moderate flooding occurred farther north along the Delaware River. Moderate to severe tidal flooding occurred along the Atlantic Coast and Raritan Bay There were six direct deaths associated with Irene, all drownings. The deaths occurred in Salem County, Mercer County (two), Ocean County (two) and Morris County. Preliminary damage estimates in the whole state of New Jersey were near one billion dollars to approximately 200,000 homes and businesses. The closure of the Atlantic City casinos (only the third time in history) for three days caused an estimated 45 million dollars in lost revenue.   The combination of wind and flooding forced the closure of about 350 main roadways in the state including sections of Interstate 287, the Garden State Parkway and the New Jersey Turnpike. The flooding rains and winds damaged the corn, peach, pumpkin, tomato,  pepper, cucumber, potato and squash crops and feared will damage the blueberry crop in 2012. Drug industry production fell the week of August 29th because of traveling problems. Free ice and water were distributed in locations with widespread power outages. The American Red Cross distributed over 1,000 clean-up kits and 100,000 meals and snacks.   ||Tropical storm force wind gusts overspread New Jersey during the late afternoon and evening of the 27th and persisted through the afternoon of the 28th. Peak wind gusts averaged around 50 mph inland and around 65 mph at the coast. The strongest winds associated with Irene occurred at two distinct times. The first surge occurred during bands of heavier rain during the evening of the 27th and early morning of the 28th. The second peak occurred during the afternoon of the 28th when skies were clearing and deeper mixing of the atmosphere brought stronger winds to the ground. Most of the inland peak wind gusts occurred at this time. The rain associated with Irene overspread New Jersey during the late morning on the 27th, fell at its heaviest during the evening of the 27th into the early morning of the 28th and ended during the early afternoon on the 28th. Event precipitation totals averaged 5 to 10 inches and caused widespread record breaking flooding. Many locations broke August's all time monthly rainfall records even before Irene arrived. Because the flash flooding and flooding blended into one, all flooding related Stormdata county entries were combined into one under flood events. The storm surge of 3 to 5 feet caused moderate to severe tidal flooding along the ocean side and moderate tidal flooding in Delaware Bay and tidal sections of the Delaware River. The tidal flooding was during the evening and overnight high tide on the 27th across southern New Jersey, Delaware Bay and the Delaware River, but with the morning high on the 28th in Northern New Jersey. The morning high tide coincided closer with the high tide cycle and caused most of the severe tidal flooding to occur there.  Minor tidal flooding persisted in tidal sections of the Delaware River during the high tide cycles from the 29th through the 31st. ||Governor Chris Christie declared a state of emergency on August 25th.

It moved northeast and passed over Puerto Rico overnight on the 21st. As Irene moved off the island, it intensified into a hurricane. Irene just bypassed the island of Hispaniola to its north and then passed over the Eastern Bahamas on the 25th as it reached category three hurricane strength. From the Bahamas, Irene moved nearly due north and slowly weakened to a category two hurricane on the 26th and a category one hurricane on the 27th. Irene made her initial landfall near Cape Lookout, North Carolina at 8 a.m. EDT on the 27th as a category one and then proceeded to the northnortheast. Irene went back over the Atlantic Ocean near the Virginia and North Carolina border at 7 p.m. EDT on the 27th. From there Irene paralleled the Delmarva Peninsula and the center passed about 15 miles east of Delaware between 3 a.m. and 4 a.m. EDT on the 28th. Irene continued to slowly weaken and made her second landfall as a tropical storm on Brigantine Island, just north of Atlantic City, New Jersey at 535 a.m. EDT on the 28th. From there the center of Irene moved along eastern parts of Ocean and Monmouth Counties and was located near Tinton Falls Township in Monmouth County at 8 a.m. EDT on the 28th.

Irene is expected to be the costliest natural disaster in the history of New Jersey. Approximately one million people were evacuated from the coast and low lying areas prone to inland flooding throughout the state of New Jersey including all of Cape May County. Irene also caused record breaking outages to utility customers as around one and a half million people lost power throughout the state. Power was not fully restored until September 5th. The widespread flooding resulted in the second highest crest (highest was with Hurricane Floyd in September 1999) on record for the Raritan Basin, but the highest crest on record for many other river basins including the Passaic. Moderate tidal flooding occurred along the tidal Delaware River and Delaware Bay and minor to moderate flooding occurred farther north along the Delaware River. Moderate to severe tidal flooding occurred along the Atlantic Coast and Raritan Bay There were six direct deaths associated with Irene, all drownings. The deaths occurred in Salem County, Mercer County (two), Ocean County (two) and Morris County. Preliminary damage estimates in the whole state of New Jersey were near one billion dollars to approximately 200,000 homes and businesses. The closure of the Atlantic City casinos (only the third time in history) for three days caused an estimated 45 million dollars in lost revenue.   The combination of wind and flooding forced the closure of about 350 main roadways in the state including sections of Interstate 287, the Garden State Parkway and the New Jersey Turnpike. The flooding rains and winds damaged the corn, peach, pumpkin, tomato,  pepper, cucumber, potato and squash crops and feared will damage the blueberry crop in 2012. Drug industry production fell the week of August 29th because of traveling problems. Free ice and water were distributed in locations with widespread power outages. The American Red Cross distributed over 1,000 clean-up kits and 100,000 meals and snacks.   ||Tropical storm force wind gusts overspread New Jersey during the late afternoon and evening of the 27th and persisted through the afternoon of the 28th. Peak wind gusts averaged around 50 mph inland and around 65 mph at the coast. The strongest winds associated with Irene occurred at two distinct times. The first surge occurred during bands of heavier rain during the evening of the 27th and early morning of the 28th. The second peak occurred during the afternoon of the 28th when skies were clearing and deeper mixing of the atmosphere brought stronger winds to the ground. Most of the inland peak wind gusts occurred at this time. The rain associated with Irene overspread New Jersey during the late morning on the 27th, fell at its heaviest during the evening of the 27th into the early morning of the 28th and ended during the early afternoon on the 28th. Event precipitation totals averaged 5 to 10 inches and caused widespread record breaking flooding. Many locations broke August's all time monthly rainfall records even before Irene arrived. Because the flash flooding and flooding blended into one, all flooding related Stormdata county entries were combined into one under flood events. The storm surge of 3 to 5 feet caused moderate to severe tidal flooding along the ocean side and moderate tidal flooding in Delaware Bay and tidal sections of the Delaware River. The tidal flooding was during the evening and overnight high tide on the 27th across southern New Jersey, Delaware Bay and the Delaware River, but with the morning high on the 28th in Northern New Jersey. The morning high tide coincided closer with the high tide cycle and caused most of the severe tidal flooding to occur there.  Minor tidal flooding persisted in tidal sections of the Delaware River during the high tide cycles from the 29th through the 31st. ||Governor Chris Christie declared a state of emergency on August 25th. New Jersey Transit rail, bus and light rail operations were suspended on the weekend of the 27th and 28th. Full transit service was not restored until Wednesday August 31st.  In Cape May County, countywide mandatory evacuations were ordered on August 25th, and for residents the next day. Traffic on New Jersey State Route 55 south of Vineland, New Jersey Route 47 and New Jersey Route 347 were only allowed to head north leaving Cape May County.||All Atlantic County shore communities east of U.S. Route 9 including Atlantic City were placed under a voluntary evacuation at 8 p.m. August 25th and the following day a mandatory evacuation effective starting 6 a.m. EDT. All Atlantic City casinos were shut down as the city faced the first mandatory evacuation in history. About 1,500 National Guard troops had been deployed in the state to help with evacuations.  In Ocean County, all of the barrier islands including Long Beach Island were under mandatory evacuation starting at 8 a.m. EDT on August 26th.  To relieve evacuation traffic, toll operations were temporarily suspended on the Garden State Parkway south of the Raritan River and on the Atlantic City Expressway. The southbound lanes on the Garden State Parkway south of exit 98 were closed at 8 p.m. EDT on August 26th, while eastbound traffic was stopped on New Jersey State Routes 70 and Route 72.||Major flooding occurred on the Raritan, Millstone, Rockaway and Passaic Rivers.  Record flows were reported at the Musconetcong River in Warren County as well as the Assunpink Creek in Mercer County and the Rancocas Creek in Burlington County. Flooding on the rivers lasted as long as September 5th. The flooding affected and closed   numerous roads, including the heavily used Interstate 287 in Boonton when the northbound shoulder collapsed from the force of the Rockaway River. The Garden State Parkway flooded in Toms River near exit 98. On Monday August 29th, eighty roadways were still closed and thirty-six roadways were still closed on the 30th.  Ninety-eight percent of the closed roadways were reopened as of September 1st.  Coupled with a reduced transit schedule, travel was described as gridlock on the 29th   Thousands of homes were also flooded, especially in Morris and Somerset Counties. Many northern New Jersey schools that were scheduled to open on the 29th were closed. ||At the Trenton Train Station along Assunpink Creek, flooding impacted Amtrak's Northeast Corridor, SEPTA's Trenton Line, and New Jersey Transit's (NJT) Northeast Corridor Rail Line. Service was not fully restored to and through Trenton until August 31st. Irene cost NJT just under $10 million in lost revenue and damaged infrastructure. Numerous homes suffered structural damages from the winds, and limbs impacting their roofs. ||In total, approximately 1.6 million customers of JCP&L and PSE&G throughout the state lost power. Two days after the storm, 500,000 PSE&G customers were still without power, down from a peak of about 928,000. By September 3 power had been restored to all but 750, but thousands of JCP&L customers were still without service. On September 2nd, 37,000 JCP&L customers were awaiting restoration of service. On Sunday September 5, power had been returned to last remaining 2,000 residents who suffered a power outage. ||There was one confirmed tornado in Mercer County, but widespread tree wind damage (and damage to homes and vehicles when trees fell on them) occurred in every county.  In addition, a few municipalities experienced stronger wind bursts that caused direct property damage. The strong winds forced the suspension of service on the Cape May Lewes Ferry.  In Monmouth County, in Long Branch, the high winds damaged two roofs of an apartment complex on Ocean Boulevard.  In Ocean County, an estimated 500 trees were knocked down.  The SpongeBob ride at the Funtown Pier in Seaside Park was damaged. In Atlantic County, a piece of an exterior wall of the Borgota Hotel was blown off.  In Gloucester County, a 61-year-old woman suffered a head injury after being struck by a tree. ||The shore took a pounding from the coastal flooding and heavy surf. A 25-year-old and a 24-year-old man drowned in Point Pleasant (Ocean County) after going to the shore to view the storm. The average sand loss was about four to five feet high and one hundred fifty feet wide.  Waves were estimated to reach as high as 12 feet as offshore seas reached 25 feet. There were numerous reports of dune fence damage and sand overwashes onto streets and boardwalks. Along the Raritan Bay side of Middlesex and Monmouth Counties, most of the vertical cuts were less than two feet and no breaches were reported. In Keansburg and Union Beach in Monmouth County low lying bayshore communities experienced tidal flooding. About 3,000 county residents were evacuated along Raritan Bay. Along the Atlantic Ocean side of Monmouth County, vertical cuts averaged 2 to 5 feet. In Spring Lake, about one and a half miles of the borough���s boardwalk was damaged and closed. In Ocean County, vertical cuts averaged 2 to 4 feet north of Barnegat Light and 4 to 6 feet south of Barnegat Light. A dune cut was reported in Harvey Cedars. Dune washovers occurred in Brant Beach. In Beach Haven, dune cuts reached 10 feet and the geotubes at Merrivale Avenue were overtopped. No flood damage to homes was reported. The entrance to the Holgate Natural Area was impassable as stone and rubble were exposed. In Atlantic County, vertical cuts averaged 1 to 4 feet, but reached 6 feet in Brigantine. In Cape May County, vertical cuts averaged 2 to 4 feet. A couple of horizontal dune cuts occurred in North Wildwood and the top cap of a timber bulkhead was knocked off.

The widespread flooding resulted in the second highest crest (highest was with Hurricane Floyd in September 1999) on record for the Raritan Basin, but the highest crest on record for many other river basins including the Passaic. Moderate tidal flooding occurred along the tidal Delaware River and Delaware Bay and minor to moderate flooding occurred farther north along the Delaware River. Moderate to severe tidal flooding occurred along the Atlantic Coast and Raritan Bay There were six direct deaths associated with Irene, all drownings. The deaths occurred in Salem County, Mercer County (two), Ocean County (two) and Morris County. Preliminary damage estimates in the whole state of New Jersey were near one billion dollars to approximately 200,000 homes and businesses. The closure of the Atlantic City casinos (only the third time in history) for three days caused an estimated 45 million dollars in lost revenue.   The combination of wind and flooding forced the closure of about 350 main roadways in the state including sections of Interstate 287, the Garden State Parkway and the New Jersey Turnpike. The flooding rains and winds damaged the corn, peach, pumpkin, tomato,  pepper, cucumber, potato and squash crops and feared will damage the blueberry crop in 2012. Drug industry production fell the week of August 29th because of traveling problems. Free ice and water were distributed in locations with widespread power outages. The American Red Cross distributed over 1,000 clean-up kits and 100,000 meals and snacks.   ||Tropical storm force wind gusts overspread New Jersey during the late afternoon and evening of the 27th and persisted through the afternoon of the 28th. Peak wind gusts averaged around 50 mph inland and around 65 mph at the coast. The strongest winds associated with Irene occurred at two distinct times. The first surge occurred during bands of heavier rain during the evening of the 27th and early morning of the 28th. The second peak occurred during the afternoon of the 28th when skies were clearing and deeper mixing of the atmosphere brought stronger winds to the ground. Most of the inland peak wind gusts occurred at this time. The rain associated with Irene overspread New Jersey during the late morning on the 27th, fell at its heaviest during the evening of the 27th into the early morning of the 28th and ended during the early afternoon on the 28th. Event precipitation totals averaged 5 to 10 inches and caused widespread record breaking flooding. Many locations broke August's all time monthly rainfall records even before Irene arrived. Because the flash flooding and flooding blended into one, all flooding related Stormdata county entries were combined into one under flood events. The storm surge of 3 to 5 feet caused moderate to severe tidal flooding along the ocean side and moderate tidal flooding in Delaware Bay and tidal sections of the Delaware River. The tidal flooding was during the evening and overnight high tide on the 27th across southern New Jersey, Delaware Bay and the Delaware River, but with the morning high on the 28th in Northern New Jersey. The morning high tide coincided closer with the high tide cycle and caused most of the severe tidal flooding to occur there.  Minor tidal flooding persisted in tidal sections of the Delaware River during the high tide cycles from the 29th through the 31st. ||Governor Chris Christie declared a state of emergency on August 25th. New Jersey Transit rail, bus and light rail operations were suspended on the weekend of the 27th and 28th. Full transit service was not restored until Wednesday August 31st.  In Cape May County, countywide mandatory evacuations were ordered on August 25th, and for residents the next day. Traffic on New Jersey State Route 55 south of Vineland, New Jersey Route 47 and New Jersey Route 347 were only allowed to head north leaving Cape May County.||All Atlantic County shore communities east of U.S. Route 9 including Atlantic City were placed under a voluntary evacuation at 8 p.m. August 25th and the following day a mandatory evacuation effective starting 6 a.m. EDT. All Atlantic City casinos were shut down as the city faced the first mandatory evacuation in history. About 1,500 National Guard troops had been deployed in the state to help with evacuations.  In Ocean County, all of the barrier islands including Long Beach Island were under mandatory evacuation starting at 8 a.m. EDT on August 26th.  To relieve evacuation traffic, toll operations were temporarily suspended on the Garden State Parkway south of the Raritan River and on the Atlantic City Expressway. The southbound lanes on the Garden State Parkway south of exit 98 were closed at 8 p.m. EDT on August 26th, while eastbound traffic was stopped on New Jersey State Routes 70 and Route 72.||Major flooding occurred on the Raritan, Millstone, Rockaway and Passaic Rivers.  Record flows were reported at the Musconetcong River in Warren County as well as the Assunpink Creek in Mercer County and the Rancocas Creek in Burlington County. Flooding on the rivers lasted as long as September 5th. The flooding affected and closed   numerous roads, including the heavily used Interstate 287 in Boonton when the northbound shoulder collapsed from the force of the Rockaway River. The Garden State Parkway flooded in Toms River near exit 98. On Monday August 29th, eighty roadways were still closed and thirty-six roadways were still closed on the 30th.  Ninety-eight percent of the closed roadways were reopened as of September 1st.  Coupled with a reduced transit schedule, travel was described as gridlock on the 29th   Thousands of homes were also flooded, especially in Morris and Somerset Counties. Many northern New Jersey schools that were scheduled to open on the 29th were closed. ||At the Trenton Train Station along Assunpink Creek, flooding impacted Amtrak's Northeast Corridor, SEPTA's Trenton Line, and New Jersey Transit's (NJT) Northeast Corridor Rail Line. Service was not fully restored to and through Trenton until August 31st. Irene cost NJT just under $10 million in lost revenue and damaged infrastructure. Numerous homes suffered structural damages from the winds, and limbs impacting their roofs. ||In total, approximately 1.6 million customers of JCP&L and PSE&G throughout the state lost power. Two days after the storm, 500,000 PSE&G customers were still without power, down from a peak of about 928,000. By September 3 power had been restored to all but 750, but thousands of JCP&L customers were still without service. On September 2nd, 37,000 JCP&L customers were awaiting restoration of service. On Sunday September 5, power had been returned to last remaining 2,000 residents who suffered a power outage. ||There was one confirmed tornado in Mercer County, but widespread tree wind damage (and damage to homes and vehicles when trees fell on them) occurred in every county.  In addition, a few municipalities experienced stronger wind bursts that caused direct property damage. The strong winds forced the suspension of service on the Cape May Lewes Ferry.  In Monmouth County, in Long Branch, the high winds damaged two roofs of an apartment complex on Ocean Boulevard.  In Ocean County, an estimated 500 trees were knocked down.  The SpongeBob ride at the Funtown Pier in Seaside Park was damaged. In Atlantic County, a piece of an exterior wall of the Borgota Hotel was blown off.  In Gloucester County, a 61-year-old woman suffered a head injury after being struck by a tree. ||The shore took a pounding from the coastal flooding and heavy surf. A 25-year-old and a 24-year-old man drowned in Point Pleasant (Ocean County) after going to the shore to view the storm. The average sand loss was about four to five feet high and one hundred fifty feet wide.  Waves were estimated to reach as high as 12 feet as offshore seas reached 25 feet. There were numerous reports of dune fence damage and sand overwashes onto streets and boardwalks. Along the Raritan Bay side of Middlesex and Monmouth Counties, most of the vertical cuts were less than two feet and no breaches were reported. In Keansburg and Union Beach in Monmouth County low lying bayshore communities experienced tidal flooding. About 3,000 county residents were evacuated along Raritan Bay. Along the Atlantic Ocean side of Monmouth County, vertical cuts averaged 2 to 5 feet. In Spring Lake, about one and a half miles of the borough���s boardwalk was damaged and closed. In Ocean County, vertical cuts averaged 2 to 4 feet north of Barnegat Light and 4 to 6 feet south of Barnegat Light. A dune cut was reported in Harvey Cedars. Dune washovers occurred in Brant Beach. In Beach Haven, dune cuts reached 10 feet and the geotubes at Merrivale Avenue were overtopped. No flood damage to homes was reported. The entrance to the Holgate Natural Area was impassable as stone and rubble were exposed. In Atlantic County, vertical cuts averaged 1 to 4 feet, but reached 6 feet in Brigantine. In Cape May County, vertical cuts averaged 2 to 4 feet. A couple of horizontal dune cuts occurred in North Wildwood and the top cap of a timber bulkhead was knocked off. In Cape May City, a horizontal dune cut occurred on Poverty Beach. | |President Barack Obama initially declared the state a disaster area, making residents of Bergen, Essex, Morris, Passaic and Somerset Counties and made them eligible for federal aid.

It moved northeast and passed over Puerto Rico overnight on the 21st. As Irene moved off the island, it intensified into a hurricane. Irene just bypassed the island of Hispaniola to its north and then passed over the Eastern Bahamas on the 25th as it reached category three hurricane strength. From the Bahamas, Irene moved nearly due north and slowly weakened to a category two hurricane on the 26th and a category one hurricane on the 27th. Irene made her initial landfall near Cape Lookout, North Carolina at 8 a.m. EDT on the 27th as a category one and then proceeded to the northnortheast. Irene went back over the Atlantic Ocean near the Virginia and North Carolina border at 7 p.m. EDT on the 27th. From there Irene paralleled the Delmarva Peninsula and the center passed about 15 miles east of Delaware between 3 a.m. and 4 a.m. EDT on the 28th. Irene continued to slowly weaken and made her second landfall as a tropical storm on Brigantine Island, just north of Atlantic City, New Jersey at 535 a.m. EDT on the 28th. From there the center of Irene moved along eastern parts of Ocean and Monmouth Counties and was located near Tinton Falls Township in Monmouth County at 8 a.m. EDT on the 28th.

Many northern New Jersey schools that were scheduled to open on the 29th were closed. ||At the Trenton Train Station along Assunpink Creek, flooding impacted Amtrak's Northeast Corridor, SEPTA's Trenton Line, and New Jersey Transit's (NJT) Northeast Corridor Rail Line. Service was not fully restored to and through Trenton until August 31st. Irene cost NJT just under $10 million in lost revenue and damaged infrastructure. Numerous homes suffered structural damages from the winds, and limbs impacting their roofs. ||In total, approximately 1.6 million customers of JCP&L and PSE&G throughout the state lost power. Two days after the storm, 500,000 PSE&G customers were still without power, down from a peak of about 928,000. By September 3 power had been restored to all but 750, but thousands of JCP&L customers were still without service. On September 2nd, 37,000 JCP&L customers were awaiting restoration of service. On Sunday September 5, power had been returned to last remaining 2,000 residents who suffered a power outage. ||There was one confirmed tornado in Mercer County, but widespread tree wind damage (and damage to homes and vehicles when trees fell on them) occurred in every county.  In addition, a few municipalities experienced stronger wind bursts that caused direct property damage. The strong winds forced the suspension of service on the Cape May Lewes Ferry.  In Monmouth County, in Long Branch, the high winds damaged two roofs of an apartment complex on Ocean Boulevard.  In Ocean County, an estimated 500 trees were knocked down.  The SpongeBob ride at the Funtown Pier in Seaside Park was damaged. In Atlantic County, a piece of an exterior wall of the Borgota Hotel was blown off.  In Gloucester County, a 61-year-old woman suffered a head injury after being struck by a tree. ||The shore took a pounding from the coastal flooding and heavy surf. A 25-year-old and a 24-year-old man drowned in Point Pleasant (Ocean County) after going to the shore to view the storm. The average sand loss was about four to five feet high and one hundred fifty feet wide.  Waves were estimated to reach as high as 12 feet as offshore seas reached 25 feet. There were numerous reports of dune fence damage and sand overwashes onto streets and boardwalks. Along the Raritan Bay side of Middlesex and Monmouth Counties, most of the vertical cuts were less than two feet and no breaches were reported. In Keansburg and Union Beach in Monmouth County low lying bayshore communities experienced tidal flooding. About 3,000 county residents were evacuated along Raritan Bay. Along the Atlantic Ocean side of Monmouth County, vertical cuts averaged 2 to 5 feet. In Spring Lake, about one and a half miles of the borough���s boardwalk was damaged and closed. In Ocean County, vertical cuts averaged 2 to 4 feet north of Barnegat Light and 4 to 6 feet south of Barnegat Light. A dune cut was reported in Harvey Cedars. Dune washovers occurred in Brant Beach. In Beach Haven, dune cuts reached 10 feet and the geotubes at Merrivale Avenue were overtopped. No flood damage to homes was reported. The entrance to the Holgate Natural Area was impassable as stone and rubble were exposed. In Atlantic County, vertical cuts averaged 1 to 4 feet, but reached 6 feet in Brigantine. In Cape May County, vertical cuts averaged 2 to 4 feet. A couple of horizontal dune cuts occurred in North Wildwood and the top cap of a timber bulkhead was knocked off. In Cape May City, a horizontal dune cut occurred on Poverty Beach. | |President Barack Obama initially declared the state a disaster area, making residents of Bergen, Essex, Morris, Passaic and Somerset Counties and made them eligible for federal aid.

It moved northeast and passed over Puerto Rico overnight on the 21st. As Irene moved off the island, it intensified into a hurricane. Irene just bypassed the island of Hispaniola to its north and then passed over the Eastern Bahamas on the 25th as it reached category three hurricane strength. From the Bahamas, Irene moved nearly due north and slowly weakened to a category two hurricane on the 26th and a category one hurricane on the 27th. Irene made her initial landfall near Cape Lookout, North Carolina at 8 a.m. EDT on the 27th as a category one and then proceeded to the northnortheast. Irene went back over the Atlantic Ocean near the Virginia and North Carolina border at 7 p.m. EDT on the 27th. From there Irene paralleled the Delmarva Peninsula and the center passed about 15 miles east of Delaware between 3 a.m. and 4 a.m. EDT on the 28th. Irene continued to slowly weaken and made her second landfall as a tropical storm on Brigantine Island, just north of Atlantic City, New Jersey at 535 a.m. EDT on the 28th. From there the center of Irene moved along eastern parts of Ocean and Monmouth Counties and was located near Tinton Falls Township in Monmouth County at 8 a.m. EDT on the 28th.

Irene is expected to be the costliest natural disaster in the history of New Jersey. Approximately one million people were evacuated from the coast and low lying areas prone to inland flooding throughout the state of New Jersey including all of Cape May County. Irene also caused record breaking outages to utility customers as around one and a half million people lost power throughout the state. Power was not fully restored until September 5th. The widespread flooding resulted in the second highest crest (highest was with Hurricane Floyd in September 1999) on record for the Raritan Basin, but the highest crest on record for many other river basins including the Passaic. Moderate tidal flooding occurred along the tidal Delaware River and Delaware Bay and minor to moderate flooding occurred farther north along the Delaware River. Moderate to severe tidal flooding occurred along the Atlantic Coast and Raritan Bay There were six direct deaths associated with Irene, all drownings. The deaths occurred in Salem County, Mercer County (two), Ocean County (two) and Morris County. Preliminary damage estimates in the whole state of New Jersey were near one billion dollars to approximately 200,000 homes and businesses. The closure of the Atlantic City casinos (only the third time in history) for three days caused an estimated 45 million dollars in lost revenue.   The combination of wind and flooding forced the closure of about 350 main roadways in the state including sections of Interstate 287, the Garden State Parkway and the New Jersey Turnpike. The flooding rains and winds damaged the corn, peach, pumpkin, tomato,  pepper, cucumber, potato and squash crops and feared will damage the blueberry crop in 2012. Drug industry production fell the week of August 29th because of traveling problems. Free ice and water were distributed in locations with widespread power outages. The American Red Cross distributed over 1,000 clean-up kits and 100,000 meals and snacks.   ||Tropical storm force wind gusts overspread New Jersey during the late afternoon and evening of the 27th and persisted through the afternoon of the 28th. Peak wind gusts averaged around 50 mph inland and around 65 mph at the coast. The strongest winds associated with Irene occurred at two distinct times. The first surge occurred during bands of heavier rain during the evening of the 27th and early morning of the 28th. The second peak occurred during the afternoon of the 28th when skies were clearing and deeper mixing of the atmosphere brought stronger winds to the ground. Most of the inland peak wind gusts occurred at this time. The rain associated with Irene overspread New Jersey during the late morning on the 27th, fell at its heaviest during the evening of the 27th into the early morning of the 28th and ended during the early afternoon on the 28th. Event precipitation totals averaged 5 to 10 inches and caused widespread record breaking flooding. Many locations broke August's all time monthly rainfall records even before Irene arrived. Because the flash flooding and flooding blended into one, all flooding related Stormdata county entries were combined into one under flood events. The storm surge of 3 to 5 feet caused moderate to severe tidal flooding along the ocean side and moderate tidal flooding in Delaware Bay and tidal sections of the Delaware River. The tidal flooding was during the evening and overnight high tide on the 27th across southern New Jersey, Delaware Bay and the Delaware River, but with the morning high on the 28th in Northern New Jersey. The morning high tide coincided closer with the high tide cycle and caused most of the severe tidal flooding to occur there.  Minor tidal flooding persisted in tidal sections of the Delaware River during the high tide cycles from the 29th through the 31st. ||Governor Chris Christie declared a state of emergency on August 25th. New Jersey Transit rail, bus and light rail operations were suspended on the weekend of the 27th and 28th. Full transit service was not restored until Wednesday August 31st.

In Ocean County, all of the barrier islands including Long Beach Island were under mandatory evacuation starting at 8 a.m. EDT on August 26th.  To relieve evacuation traffic, toll operations were temporarily suspended on the Garden State Parkway south of the Raritan River and on the Atlantic City Expressway. The southbound lanes on the Garden State Parkway south of exit 98 were closed at 8 p.m. EDT on August 26th, while eastbound traffic was stopped on New Jersey State Routes 70 and Route 72.||Major flooding occurred on the Raritan, Millstone, Rockaway and Passaic Rivers.  Record flows were reported at the Musconetcong River in Warren County as well as the Assunpink Creek in Mercer County and the Rancocas Creek in Burlington County.

It moved northeast and passed over Puerto Rico overnight on the 21st. As Irene moved off the island, it intensified into a hurricane. Irene just bypassed the island of Hispaniola to its north and then passed over the Eastern Bahamas on the 25th as it reached category three hurricane strength. From the Bahamas, Irene moved nearly due north and slowly weakened to a category two hurricane on the 26th and a category one hurricane on the 27th. Irene made her initial landfall near Cape Lookout, North Carolina at 8 a.m. EDT on the 27th as a category one and then proceeded to the northnortheast. Irene went back over the Atlantic Ocean near the Virginia and North Carolina border at 7 p.m. EDT on the 27th. From there Irene paralleled the Delmarva Peninsula and the center passed about 15 miles east of Delaware between 3 a.m. and 4 a.m. EDT on the 28th. Irene continued to slowly weaken and made her second landfall as a tropical storm on Brigantine Island, just north of Atlantic City, New Jersey at 535 a.m. EDT on the 28th. From there the center of Irene moved along eastern parts of Ocean and Monmouth Counties and was located near Tinton Falls Township in Monmouth County at 8 a.m. EDT on the 28th. At about 9 a.m. EDT the center of Irene passed over New York City.||Irene helped make August 2011 the wettest August on record for the state of New Jersey dating back to 1895.

Irene is expected to be the costliest natural disaster in the history of New Jersey. Approximately one million people were evacuated from the coast and low lying areas prone to inland flooding throughout the state of New Jersey including all of Cape May County. Irene also caused record breaking outages to utility customers as around one and a half million people lost power throughout the state. Power was not fully restored until September 5th. The widespread flooding resulted in the second highest crest (highest was with Hurricane Floyd in September 1999) on record for the Raritan Basin, but the highest crest on record for many other river basins including the Passaic. Moderate tidal flooding occurred along the tidal Delaware River and Delaware Bay and minor to moderate flooding occurred farther north along the Delaware River. Moderate to severe tidal flooding occurred along the Atlantic Coast and Raritan Bay There were six direct deaths associated with Irene, all drownings. The deaths occurred in Salem County, Mercer County (two), Ocean County (two) and Morris County. Preliminary damage estimates in the whole state of New Jersey were near one billion dollars to approximately 200,000 homes and businesses. The closure of the Atlantic City casinos (only the third time in history) for three days caused an estimated 45 million dollars in lost revenue.   The combination of wind and flooding forced the closure of about 350 main roadways in the state including sections of Interstate 287, the Garden State Parkway and the New Jersey Turnpike. The flooding rains and winds damaged the corn, peach, pumpkin, tomato,  pepper, cucumber, potato and squash crops and feared will damage the blueberry crop in 2012. Drug industry production fell the week of August 29th because of traveling problems. Free ice and water were distributed in locations with widespread power outages. The American Red Cross distributed over 1,000 clean-up kits and 100,000 meals and snacks.   ||Tropical storm force wind gusts overspread New Jersey during the late afternoon and evening of the 27th and persisted through the afternoon of the 28th. Peak wind gusts averaged around 50 mph inland and around 65 mph at the coast. The strongest winds associated with Irene occurred at two distinct times. The first surge occurred during bands of heavier rain during the evening of the 27th and early morning of the 28th. The second peak occurred during the afternoon of the 28th when skies were clearing and deeper mixing of the atmosphere brought stronger winds to the ground. Most of the inland peak wind gusts occurred at this time. The rain associated with Irene overspread New Jersey during the late morning on the 27th, fell at its heaviest during the evening of the 27th into the early morning of the 28th and ended during the early afternoon on the 28th. Event precipitation totals averaged 5 to 10 inches and caused widespread record breaking flooding. Many locations broke August's all time monthly rainfall records even before Irene arrived. Because the flash flooding and flooding blended into one, all flooding related Stormdata county entries were combined into one under flood events. The storm surge of 3 to 5 feet caused moderate to severe tidal flooding along the ocean side and moderate tidal flooding in Delaware Bay and tidal sections of the Delaware River. The tidal flooding was during the evening and overnight high tide on the 27th across southern New Jersey, Delaware Bay and the Delaware River, but with the morning high on the 28th in Northern New Jersey. The morning high tide coincided closer with the high tide cycle and caused most of the severe tidal flooding to occur there.  Minor tidal flooding persisted in tidal sections of the Delaware River during the high tide cycles from the 29th through the 31st. ||Governor Chris Christie declared a state of emergency on August 25th. New Jersey Transit rail, bus and light rail operations were suspended on the weekend of the 27th and 28th. Full transit service was not restored until Wednesday August 31st.  In Cape May County, countywide mandatory evacuations were ordered on August 25th, and for residents the next day. Traffic on New Jersey State Route 55 south of Vineland, New Jersey Route 47 and New Jersey Route 347 were only allowed to head north leaving Cape May County.||All Atlantic County shore communities east of U.S. Route 9 including Atlantic City were placed under a voluntary evacuation at 8 p.m. August 25th and the following day a mandatory evacuation effective starting 6 a.m. EDT. All Atlantic City casinos were shut down as the city faced the first mandatory evacuation in history. About 1,500 National Guard troops had been deployed in the state to help with evacuations.  In Ocean County, all of the barrier islands including Long Beach Island were under mandatory evacuation starting at 8 a.m. EDT on August 26th.  To relieve evacuation traffic, toll operations were temporarily suspended on the Garden State Parkway south of the Raritan River and on the Atlantic City Expressway. The southbound lanes on the Garden State Parkway south of exit 98 were closed at 8 p.m. EDT on August 26th, while eastbound traffic was stopped on New Jersey State Routes 70 and Route 72.||Major flooding occurred on the Raritan, Millstone, Rockaway and Passaic Rivers.  Record flows were reported at the Musconetcong River in Warren County as well as the Assunpink Creek in Mercer County and the Rancocas Creek in Burlington County. Flooding on the rivers lasted as long as September 5th. The flooding affected and closed   numerous roads, including the heavily used Interstate 287 in Boonton when the northbound shoulder collapsed from the force of the Rockaway River. The Garden State Parkway flooded in Toms River near exit 98. On Monday August 29th, eighty roadways were still closed and thirty-six roadways were still closed on the 30th.  Ninety-eight percent of the closed roadways were reopened as of September 1st.  Coupled with a reduced transit schedule, travel was described as gridlock on the 29th   Thousands of homes were also flooded, especially in Morris and Somerset Counties. Many northern New Jersey schools that were scheduled to open on the 29th were closed. ||At the Trenton Train Station along Assunpink Creek, flooding impacted Amtrak's Northeast Corridor, SEPTA's Trenton Line, and New Jersey Transit's (NJT) Northeast Corridor Rail Line. Service was not fully restored to and through Trenton until August 31st. Irene cost NJT just under $10 million in lost revenue and damaged infrastructure. Numerous homes suffered structural damages from the winds, and limbs impacting their roofs. ||In total, approximately 1.6 million customers of JCP&L and PSE&G throughout the state lost power. Two days after the storm, 500,000 PSE&G customers were still without power, down from a peak of about 928,000. By September 3 power had been restored to all but 750, but thousands of JCP&L customers were still without service. On September 2nd, 37,000 JCP&L customers were awaiting restoration of service. On Sunday September 5, power had been returned to last remaining 2,000 residents who suffered a power outage. ||There was one confirmed tornado in Mercer County, but widespread tree wind damage (and damage to homes and vehicles when trees fell on them) occurred in every county.  In addition, a few municipalities experienced stronger wind bursts that caused direct property damage. The strong winds forced the suspension of service on the Cape May Lewes Ferry.  In Monmouth County, in Long Branch, the high winds damaged two roofs of an apartment complex on Ocean Boulevard.  In Ocean County, an estimated 500 trees were knocked down.  The SpongeBob ride at the Funtown Pier in Seaside Park was damaged. In Atlantic County, a piece of an exterior wall of the Borgota Hotel was blown off.  In Gloucester County, a 61-year-old woman suffered a head injury after being struck by a tree. ||The shore took a pounding from the coastal flooding and heavy surf. A 25-year-old and a 24-year-old man drowned in Point Pleasant (Ocean County) after going to the shore to view the storm. The average sand loss was about four to five feet high and one hundred fifty feet wide.  Waves were estimated to reach as high as 12 feet as offshore seas reached 25 feet. There were numerous reports of dune fence damage and sand overwashes onto streets and boardwalks. Along the Raritan Bay side of Middlesex and Monmouth Counties, most of the vertical cuts were less than two feet and no breaches were reported. In Keansburg and Union Beach in Monmouth County low lying bayshore communities experienced tidal flooding. About 3,000 county residents were evacuated along Raritan Bay. Along the Atlantic Ocean side of Monmouth County, vertical cuts averaged 2 to 5 feet. In Spring Lake, about one and a half miles of the borough���s boardwalk was damaged and closed. In Ocean County, vertical cuts averaged 2 to 4 feet north of Barnegat Light and 4 to 6 feet south of Barnegat Light. A dune cut was reported in Harvey Cedars. Dune washovers occurred in Brant Beach. In Beach Haven, dune cuts reached 10 feet and the geotubes at Merrivale Avenue were overtopped. No flood damage to homes was reported. The entrance to the Holgate Natural Area was impassable as stone and rubble were exposed. In Atlantic County, vertical cuts averaged 1 to 4 feet, but reached 6 feet in Brigantine. In Cape May County, vertical cuts averaged 2 to 4 feet. A couple of horizontal dune cuts occurred in North Wildwood and the top cap of a timber bulkhead was knocked off. In Cape May City, a horizontal dune cut occurred on Poverty Beach. | |President Barack Obama initially declared the state a disaster area, making residents of Bergen, Essex, Morris, Passaic and Somerset Counties and made them eligible for federal aid.

The closure of the Atlantic City casinos (only the third time in history) for three days caused an estimated 45 million dollars in lost revenue.   The combination of wind and flooding forced the closure of about 350 main roadways in the state including sections of Interstate 287, the Garden State Parkway and the New Jersey Turnpike. The flooding rains and winds damaged the corn, peach, pumpkin, tomato,  pepper, cucumber, potato and squash crops and feared will damage the blueberry crop in 2012. Drug industry production fell the week of August 29th because of traveling problems. Free ice and water were distributed in locations with widespread power outages. The American Red Cross distributed over 1,000 clean-up kits and 100,000 meals and snacks.   ||Tropical storm force wind gusts overspread New Jersey during the late afternoon and evening of the 27th and persisted through the afternoon of the 28th. Peak wind gusts averaged around 50 mph inland and around 65 mph at the coast. The strongest winds associated with Irene occurred at two distinct times. The first surge occurred during bands of heavier rain during the evening of the 27th and early morning of the 28th. The second peak occurred during the afternoon of the 28th when skies were clearing and deeper mixing of the atmosphere brought stronger winds to the ground. Most of the inland peak wind gusts occurred at this time. The rain associated with Irene overspread New Jersey during the late morning on the 27th, fell at its heaviest during the evening of the 27th into the early morning of the 28th and ended during the early afternoon on the 28th. Event precipitation totals averaged 5 to 10 inches and caused widespread record breaking flooding. Many locations broke August's all time monthly rainfall records even before Irene arrived. Because the flash flooding and flooding blended into one, all flooding related Stormdata county entries were combined into one under flood events. The storm surge of 3 to 5 feet caused moderate to severe tidal flooding along the ocean side and moderate tidal flooding in Delaware Bay and tidal sections of the Delaware River. The tidal flooding was during the evening and overnight high tide on the 27th across southern New Jersey, Delaware Bay and the Delaware River, but with the morning high on the 28th in Northern New Jersey. The morning high tide coincided closer with the high tide cycle and caused most of the severe tidal flooding to occur there.  Minor tidal flooding persisted in tidal sections of the Delaware River during the high tide cycles from the 29th through the 31st. ||Governor Chris Christie declared a state of emergency on August 25th. New Jersey Transit rail, bus and light rail operations were suspended on the weekend of the 27th and 28th. Full transit service was not restored until Wednesday August 31st.  In Cape May County, countywide mandatory evacuations were ordered on August 25th, and for residents the next day. Traffic on New Jersey State Route 55 south of Vineland, New Jersey Route 47 and New Jersey Route 347 were only allowed to head north leaving Cape May County.||All Atlantic County shore communities east of U.S. Route 9 including Atlantic City were placed under a voluntary evacuation at 8 p.m. August 25th and the following day a mandatory evacuation effective starting 6 a.m. EDT. All Atlantic City casinos were shut down as the city faced the first mandatory evacuation in history. About 1,500 National Guard troops had been deployed in the state to help with evacuations.  In Ocean County, all of the barrier islands including Long Beach Island were under mandatory evacuation starting at 8 a.m. EDT on August 26th.  To relieve evacuation traffic, toll operations were temporarily suspended on the Garden State Parkway south of the Raritan River and on the Atlantic City Expressway. The southbound lanes on the Garden State Parkway south of exit 98 were closed at 8 p.m. EDT on August 26th, while eastbound traffic was stopped on New Jersey State Routes 70 and Route 72.||Major flooding occurred on the Raritan, Millstone, Rockaway and Passaic Rivers.  Record flows were reported at the Musconetcong River in Warren County as well as the Assunpink Creek in Mercer County and the Rancocas Creek in Burlington County. Flooding on the rivers lasted as long as September 5th. The flooding affected and closed   numerous roads, including the heavily used Interstate 287 in Boonton when the northbound shoulder collapsed from the force of the Rockaway River. The Garden State Parkway flooded in Toms River near exit 98. On Monday August 29th, eighty roadways were still closed and thirty-six roadways were still closed on the 30th.  Ninety-eight percent of the closed roadways were reopened as of September 1st.  Coupled with a reduced transit schedule, travel was described as gridlock on the 29th   Thousands of homes were also flooded, especially in Morris and Somerset Counties. Many northern New Jersey schools that were scheduled to open on the 29th were closed. ||At the Trenton Train Station along Assunpink Creek, flooding impacted Amtrak's Northeast Corridor, SEPTA's Trenton Line, and New Jersey Transit's (NJT) Northeast Corridor Rail Line. Service was not fully restored to and through Trenton until August 31st. Irene cost NJT just under $10 million in lost revenue and damaged infrastructure. Numerous homes suffered structural damages from the winds, and limbs impacting their roofs. ||In total, approximately 1.6 million customers of JCP&L and PSE&G throughout the state lost power. Two days after the storm, 500,000 PSE&G customers were still without power, down from a peak of about 928,000. By September 3 power had been restored to all but 750, but thousands of JCP&L customers were still without service. On September 2nd, 37,000 JCP&L customers were awaiting restoration of service. On Sunday September 5, power had been returned to last remaining 2,000 residents who suffered a power outage. ||There was one confirmed tornado in Mercer County, but widespread tree wind damage (and damage to homes and vehicles when trees fell on them) occurred in every county.  In addition, a few municipalities experienced stronger wind bursts that caused direct property damage. The strong winds forced the suspension of service on the Cape May Lewes Ferry.  In Monmouth County, in Long Branch, the high winds damaged two roofs of an apartment complex on Ocean Boulevard.  In Ocean County, an estimated 500 trees were knocked down.  The SpongeBob ride at the Funtown Pier in Seaside Park was damaged. In Atlantic County, a piece of an exterior wall of the Borgota Hotel was blown off.  In Gloucester County, a 61-year-old woman suffered a head injury after being struck by a tree. ||The shore took a pounding from the coastal flooding and heavy surf. A 25-year-old and a 24-year-old man drowned in Point Pleasant (Ocean County) after going to the shore to view the storm. The average sand loss was about four to five feet high and one hundred fifty feet wide.  Waves were estimated to reach as high as 12 feet as offshore seas reached 25 feet. There were numerous reports of dune fence damage and sand overwashes onto streets and boardwalks. Along the Raritan Bay side of Middlesex and Monmouth Counties, most of the vertical cuts were less than two feet and no breaches were reported. In Keansburg and Union Beach in Monmouth County low lying bayshore communities experienced tidal flooding. About 3,000 county residents were evacuated along Raritan Bay. Along the Atlantic Ocean side of Monmouth County, vertical cuts averaged 2 to 5 feet. In Spring Lake, about one and a half miles of the borough���s boardwalk was damaged and closed. In Ocean County, vertical cuts averaged 2 to 4 feet north of Barnegat Light and 4 to 6 feet south of Barnegat Light. A dune cut was reported in Harvey Cedars. Dune washovers occurred in Brant Beach. In Beach Haven, dune cuts reached 10 feet and the geotubes at Merrivale Avenue were overtopped. No flood damage to homes was reported. The entrance to the Holgate Natural Area was impassable as stone and rubble were exposed. In Atlantic County, vertical cuts averaged 1 to 4 feet, but reached 6 feet in Brigantine. In Cape May County, vertical cuts averaged 2 to 4 feet. A couple of horizontal dune cuts occurred in North Wildwood and the top cap of a timber bulkhead was knocked off. In Cape May City, a horizontal dune cut occurred on Poverty Beach. | |President Barack Obama initially declared the state a disaster area, making residents of Bergen, Essex, Morris, Passaic and Somerset Counties and made them eligible for federal aid.

Along tidal sections of the Delaware River, Big Timber Creek flooded along the Gloucester and Camden County lines and about 300 homes in Burlington City (Burlington County) had flooded basements.   ||Hurricane Irene formed east of the Leeward Islands on Saturday the 20th. It moved northeast and passed over Puerto Rico overnight on the 21st. As Irene moved off the island, it intensified into a hurricane. Irene just bypassed the island of Hispaniola to its north and then passed over the Eastern Bahamas on the 25th as it reached category three hurricane strength. From the Bahamas, Irene moved nearly due north and slowly weakened to a category two hurricane on the 26th and a category one hurricane on the 27th. Irene made her initial landfall near Cape Lookout, North Carolina at 8 a.m. EDT on the 27th as a category one and then proceeded to the northnortheast. Irene went back over the Atlantic Ocean near the Virginia and North Carolina border at 7 p.m. EDT on the 27th. From there Irene paralleled the Delmarva Peninsula and the center passed about 15 miles east of Delaware between 3 a.m. and 4 a.m. EDT on the 28th. Irene continued to slowly weaken and made her second landfall as a tropical storm on Brigantine Island, just north of Atlantic City, New Jersey at 535 a.m. EDT on the 28th. From there the center of Irene moved along eastern parts of Ocean and Monmouth Counties and was located near Tinton Falls Township in Monmouth County at 8 a.m. EDT on the 28th.

Irene is expected to be the costliest natural disaster in the history of New Jersey. Approximately one million people were evacuated from the coast and low lying areas prone to inland flooding throughout the state of New Jersey including all of Cape May County. Irene also caused record breaking outages to utility customers as around one and a half million people lost power throughout the state. Power was not fully restored until September 5th. The widespread flooding resulted in the second highest crest (highest was with Hurricane Floyd in September 1999) on record for the Raritan Basin, but the highest crest on record for many other river basins including the Passaic. Moderate tidal flooding occurred along the tidal Delaware River and Delaware Bay and minor to moderate flooding occurred farther north along the Delaware River.

By September 3 power had been restored to all but 750, but thousands of JCP&L customers were still without service. On September 2nd, 37,000 JCP&L customers were awaiting restoration of service. On Sunday September 5, power had been returned to last remaining 2,000 residents who suffered a power outage. ||There was one confirmed tornado in Mercer County, but widespread tree wind damage (and damage to homes and vehicles when trees fell on them) occurred in every county.  In addition, a few municipalities experienced stronger wind bursts that caused direct property damage. The strong winds forced the suspension of service on the Cape May Lewes Ferry.  In Monmouth County, in Long Branch, the high winds damaged two roofs of an apartment complex on Ocean Boulevard.  In Ocean County, an estimated 500 trees were knocked down.  The SpongeBob ride at the Funtown Pier in Seaside Park was damaged. In Atlantic County, a piece of an exterior wall of the Borgota Hotel was blown off.  In Gloucester County, a 61-year-old woman suffered a head injury after being struck by a tree. ||The shore took a pounding from the coastal flooding and heavy surf. A 25-year-old and a 24-year-old man drowned in Point Pleasant (Ocean County) after going to the shore to view the storm. The average sand loss was about four to five feet high and one hundred fifty feet wide.  Waves were estimated to reach as high as 12 feet as offshore seas reached 25 feet. There were numerous reports of dune fence damage and sand overwashes onto streets and boardwalks. Along the Raritan Bay side of Middlesex and Monmouth Counties, most of the vertical cuts were less than two feet and no breaches were reported. In Keansburg and Union Beach in Monmouth County low lying bayshore communities experienced tidal flooding. About 3,000 county residents were evacuated along Raritan Bay. Along the Atlantic Ocean side of Monmouth County, vertical cuts averaged 2 to 5 feet. In Spring Lake, about one and a half miles of the borough���s boardwalk was damaged and closed. In Ocean County, vertical cuts averaged 2 to 4 feet north of Barnegat Light and 4 to 6 feet south of Barnegat Light. A dune cut was reported in Harvey Cedars. Dune washovers occurred in Brant Beach. In Beach Haven, dune cuts reached 10 feet and the geotubes at Merrivale Avenue were overtopped. No flood damage to homes was reported. The entrance to the Holgate Natural Area was impassable as stone and rubble were exposed. In Atlantic County, vertical cuts averaged 1 to 4 feet, but reached 6 feet in Brigantine. In Cape May County, vertical cuts averaged 2 to 4 feet. A couple of horizontal dune cuts occurred in North Wildwood and the top cap of a timber bulkhead was knocked off. In Cape May City, a horizontal dune cut occurred on Poverty Beach. | |President Barack Obama initially declared the state a disaster area, making residents of Bergen, Essex, Morris, Passaic and Somerset Counties and made them eligible for federal aid. The declaration was later extended throughout the state.||The highest wind gusts recorded during Hurricane Irene were 75 mph at Cape May Ferry Terminal (Cape May County), 69 mph in Harvey Cedars (Ocean County), 69 mph in Tuckerton (Ocean County), 68 mph in Cape May Harbor (Cape May County), 66 mph at the Atlantic City Marina (Atlantic County), 66 mph in Ocean City (Cape May County), 65 mph in Point Pleasant (Ocean County), 58 mph in Atlantic City (Atlantic County), 58 mph in Sandy Hook (Monmouth County), 58 mph in Brick (Ocean County), 57 mph in Keansburg (Monmouth County), 55 mph in Barnegat Light (Ocean County), 55 mph at Lakehurst NAS (Ocean County), 55 mph at Point Point (Atlantic County), 55 mph in Seaside Heights (Ocean County), 53 mph at Wildwood (Cape May County), 52 mph in Belmar (Monmouth County), 52 mph in Bivalve (Cumberland County), 52 mph in Trenton (Mercer County), 51 mph at Ft Dix-Wrightstown (Burlington County), 50 mph in Wantage (Sussex County), 47 mph in Mount Holly (Burlington County) and 42 mph in Somerville (Somerset County).||Peak storm tides included 9.75 feet above mean lower low water in Sandy Hook (Monmouth County).

It moved northeast and passed over Puerto Rico overnight on the 21st. As Irene moved off the island, it intensified into a hurricane. Irene just bypassed the island of Hispaniola to its north and then passed over the Eastern Bahamas on the 25th as it reached category three hurricane strength. From the Bahamas, Irene moved nearly due north and slowly weakened to a category two hurricane on the 26th and a category one hurricane on the 27th. Irene made her initial landfall near Cape Lookout, North Carolina at 8 a.m. EDT on the 27th as a category one and then proceeded to the northnortheast. Irene went back over the Atlantic Ocean near the Virginia and North Carolina border at 7 p.m. EDT on the 27th. From there Irene paralleled the Delmarva Peninsula and the center passed about 15 miles east of Delaware between 3 a.m. and 4 a.m. EDT on the 28th. Irene continued to slowly weaken and made her second landfall as a tropical storm on Brigantine Island, just north of Atlantic City, New Jersey at 535 a.m. EDT on the 28th. From there the center of Irene moved along eastern parts of Ocean and Monmouth Counties and was located near Tinton Falls Township in Monmouth County at 8 a.m. EDT on the 28th. At about 9 a.m. EDT the center of Irene passed over New York City.||Irene helped make August 2011 the wettest August on record for the state of New Jersey dating back to 1895.
