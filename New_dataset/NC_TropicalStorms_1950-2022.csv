The storm moved north, through Georgetown, Williamsburg, and Florence counties.  Gaston weakened to a tropical depression that night as it moved into Marion county and the remnants moved to Dillon county the morning of the 30th.  Rainfall was the main element of the storm, with the heaviest swath of precipitation from Williamsburg county, through Florence and Darlington counties.  Around five inches of rainfall on average occurred in this area with over ten inches of rain in the Kingstree area in Williamsburg county.  Flash flooding was reported in Lake City and in Darlington during the late afternoon and evening.  Many roads were flooded and closed in Kingstree, Greeleyville, and Hemingway.  Front street in Georgetown was also closed.  A tornado watch was issued, with one confirmed tornado near Wallace in Marlboro county.  In North Carolina, rainfall ranged from around an inch near the coast, to near five inches in Robeson county, with street flooding. The winds associated with Gaston were not much of a factor, with the peak wind of 58 mph recorded at the Springmaid pier in Myrtle Beach.  There were numerous limbs down, with some minor power outages.  There was minor beach erosion reported at Bald Head Island and on the east side of Ocean Isle Beach.  The effects of Gaston were felt weeks after, with widespread river flooding over the entire area.  The Lumber river at Lumberton had record flooding, with a crest nearly eight feet above flood stage.  There were several evacuations of homes in the Quinby area, and some flooding of farmlands in Pee Dee.","",17

Tropical storm Ernesto made landfall on the eastern coast of Brunswick county near 10:30 pm EST. The maximum wind speed was recorded at Wrightsville Beach at 74 mph. A 66 mph wind gusts was recorded at Kure Beach and at Bald Head Island the peak wind was 65 mph. Anemometers across the of southeast North Carolina recorded lesser wind speeds, with wind gusts averaging between 35-50 mph.   Thousands of residents lost power at the height of the storm. During the early morning hours Ernesto moved north, and Tropical Storm warnings were lowered for southeast North Carolina at 7:00 am EST, September 1st.  
Most of the property damage was due to rainfall and fresh water flooding, with little structural damage from wind.  Rainfall storm totals ranged from 4.5 inches in Columbus county to nearly 12 inches along the coast of Pender county. In Pender county, the Northeast Cape Fear river crested at 16.7 feet, almost 7 feet above the flood stage of 10 feet.  This was the second highest crest on record, exceeded only by Hurricane Floyd at 22.5 feet. Flooding on the Northeast Cape Fear river caused 1600 people to evacuate near the town of Burgaw, including the Birch Creek and River Bend communities.  The heavy rains contributed to multiple sewer spills, most notable in New Hanover county.   Crop damage was extensive, particularly in Columbus and Pender counties.  In Pender county, over 12000 acres of corn were destroyed, 13000 acres of soybeans, 7000 acres of cotton, and 760 acres of tobacco were also damaged.  Thousands of turkeys and chickens were also lost due to the tropical storm.  Along the coast, storm surge was less than 3 ft.

Rainfall amounts over 12 inches occurred in multiple areas of the county. Wind gusts were surprisingly high, with a gust to 67 mph at the Lumberton Airport.  Tropical storm force winds and flooded ground caused widespread tree and power line damage. The river gauge at the Lumber River at Lumberton failed, however the high watermark data from the U.S. Geological Survey indicated the water level may have reached over 25 feet. This exceeded the previous record by over 4 feet. This level bypassed the levee that protects parts of Lumberton from the river due to water passing under I-95 via VFR road. One elderly male died in his home on West Fifth Street on 10/9. The man had a heart condition and when power was lost, he was without oxygen. The family believes he may have died of a heart attack and then fell into flood waters which had overtaken his home from the Lumber River. The Lumber River also exceeded record levels at Boardman by about 2.5 feet. This resulted in the closure of U. S. Route 74, the main route between Wilmington and Lumberton. Numerous water rescues were required along and near the Lumber River. Many homes were flooded in Pembroke. This was one of the hardest hit counties due to the historic river flooding.

Dorian formed on August 24, 2019 from a tropical wave in the Central Atlantic and gradually strengthened as it moved toward the Lesser Antilles, becoming a hurricane on August 28. Rapid intensification occurred, and on August 31, Dorian became a Category 4 hurricane. On September 1, Dorian reached Category 5 intensity, with maximum sustained winds of 185 mph, and a minimum central pressure of 910 mb  (26.87 inHg) while making landfall in Elbow Cay, Bahamas. Dorian made another landfall on Grand Bahama several hours later. The ridge of high pressure steering Dorian westward collapsed on September 2, causing Dorian to stall just north of Grand Bahama for about a day. It is the strongest known tropical system to impact the Bahamas. A combination of cold water upwelling and an eyewall replacement cycle weakened Dorian to a Category 2 hurricane on the next day. On the morning of September 3, Dorian began to move slowly towards the north-northwest. Dorian subsequently completed its eyewall replacement cycle and moved over warmer waters, regaining Category 3 intensity by midnight on September 5. In the early hours of September 6, Dorian weakened to Category 1 intensity as it picked up speed and turned northeast. Dorian would pick up speed and move northeast along the North Carolina coast September 6, moving east of the Crystal Coast, clipping Cape Lookout and eventually making landfall at Cape Hatteras before making yet another landfall in Nova Scotia on September 8.||The initial impacts from Dorian actually occurred during the morning hours of September 5 when several tornadoes touched down in eastern North Carolina. The most damaging tornado occurred in Emerald Isle in Carteret County. The tornado touched down shortly after 9 AM and damaged numerous businesses and homes, including the Salty Pirate Water Park. This tornado was rated an EF-2 on the Enhanced Fujita scale with estimated winds of 115 mph. As the eye of Dorian moved northeastward and clipped Cape Lookout, peak wind gusts of 110 mph were recorded at the Cedar Island Ferry Terminal, 89 mph at Fort Macon, 85 mph at Beaufort and 82 mph at Cape Lookout. Wind gusts around 100 mph were also recorded on Hatteras Island. Rainfall amounts of 5 to 10 inches were recorded across a broad area of Eastern North Carolina. Storm surge flooding occurred in Cedar Island, Hatteras Island, and Ocracoke Island. The most severe storm surge flooding occurred in Ocracoke where several people were trapped in their attics by flooding from the 4-to-7-foot storm surge, requiring rescue by boats. People were airlifted off the island to shelters on the mainland while food and water were brought in to residents on the island. North Carolina Highway 12 along Ocracoke Island suffered significant damage from flooding. More than 190,000 North Carolina homes lost power during the storm.",337

Dorian formed on August 24, 2019 from a tropical wave in the Central Atlantic and gradually strengthened as it moved toward the Lesser Antilles, becoming a hurricane on August 28. Rapid intensification occurred, and on August 31, Dorian became a Category 4 hurricane. On September 1, Dorian reached Category 5 intensity, with maximum sustained winds of 185 mph, and a minimum central pressure of 910 mb  (26.87 inHg) while making landfall in Elbow Cay, Bahamas. Dorian made another landfall on Grand Bahama several hours later. The ridge of high pressure steering Dorian westward collapsed on September 2, causing Dorian to stall just north of Grand Bahama for about a day. It is the strongest known tropical system to impact the Bahamas. A combination of cold water upwelling and an eyewall replacement cycle weakened Dorian to a Category 2 hurricane on the next day. On the morning of September 3, Dorian began to move slowly towards the north-northwest. Dorian subsequently completed its eyewall replacement cycle and moved over warmer waters, regaining Category 3 intensity by midnight on September 5. In the early hours of September 6, Dorian weakened to Category 1 intensity as it picked up speed and turned northeast. Dorian would pick up speed and move northeast along the North Carolina coast September 6, moving east of the Crystal Coast, clipping Cape Lookout and eventually making landfall at Cape Hatteras before making yet another landfall in Nova Scotia on September 8.||The initial impacts from Dorian actually occurred during the morning hours of September 5 when several tornadoes touched down in eastern North Carolina. The most damaging tornado occurred in Emerald Isle in Carteret County. The tornado touched down shortly after 9 AM and damaged numerous businesses and homes, including the Salty Pirate Water Park. This tornado was rated an EF-2 on the Enhanced Fujita scale with estimated winds of 115 mph. As the eye of Dorian moved northeastward and clipped Cape Lookout, peak wind gusts of 110 mph were recorded at the Cedar Island Ferry Terminal, 89 mph at Fort Macon, 85 mph at Beaufort and 82 mph at Cape Lookout. Wind gusts around 100 mph were also recorded on Hatteras Island. Rainfall amounts of 5 to 10 inches were recorded across a broad area of Eastern North Carolina. Storm surge flooding occurred in Cedar Island, Hatteras Island, and Ocracoke Island. The most severe storm surge flooding occurred in Ocracoke where several people were trapped in their attics by flooding from the 4-to-7-foot storm surge, requiring rescue by boats. People were airlifted off the island to shelters on the mainland while food and water were brought in to residents on the island. North Carolina Highway 12 along Ocracoke Island suffered significant damage from flooding. More than 190,000 North Carolina homes lost power during the storm.",345

The most damaging tornado occurred in Emerald Isle in Carteret County. The tornado touched down shortly after 9 AM and damaged numerous businesses and homes, including the Salty Pirate Water Park. This tornado was rated an EF-2 on the Enhanced Fujita scale with estimated winds of 115 mph. As the eye of Dorian moved northeastward and clipped Cape Lookout, peak wind gusts of 110 mph were recorded at the Cedar Island Ferry Terminal, 89 mph at Fort Macon, 85 mph at Beaufort and 82 mph at Cape Lookout. Wind gusts around 100 mph were also recorded on Hatteras Island. Rainfall amounts of 5 to 10 inches were recorded across a broad area of Eastern North Carolina. Storm surge flooding occurred in Cedar Island, Hatteras Island, and Ocracoke Island. The most severe storm surge flooding occurred in Ocracoke where several people were trapped in their attics by flooding from the 4-to-7-foot storm surge, requiring rescue by boats. People were airlifted off the island to shelters on the mainland while food and water were brought in to residents on the island. North Carolina Highway 12 along Ocracoke Island suffered significant damage from flooding. More than 190,000 North Carolina homes lost power during the storm.",361

Dorian formed on August 24, 2019 from a tropical wave in the Central Atlantic and gradually strengthened as it moved toward the Lesser Antilles, becoming a hurricane on August 28. Rapid intensification occurred, and on August 31, Dorian became a Category 4 hurricane. On September 1, Dorian reached Category 5 intensity, with maximum sustained winds of 185 mph, and a minimum central pressure of 910 mb  (26.87 inHg) while making landfall in Elbow Cay, Bahamas. Dorian made another landfall on Grand Bahama several hours later. The ridge of high pressure steering Dorian westward collapsed on September 2, causing Dorian to stall just north of Grand Bahama for about a day. It is the strongest known tropical system to impact the Bahamas. A combination of cold water upwelling and an eyewall replacement cycle weakened Dorian to a Category 2 hurricane on the next day. On the morning of September 3, Dorian began to move slowly towards the north-northwest. Dorian subsequently completed its eyewall replacement cycle and moved over warmer waters, regaining Category 3 intensity by midnight on September 5. In the early hours of September 6, Dorian weakened to Category 1 intensity as it picked up speed and turned northeast.
